These are accompanied by the full bibliographic references to the work appearing in the bibliography or reference list, often following the end of the main text, and is called a \"reference\" or \"bibliographic reference.\" Traditional print citations include \"pinpointing\" information, typically in the form of a page range that identifies which part of the cited work is being referenced.
