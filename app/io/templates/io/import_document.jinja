Here you can import new terms from a CSV file containing a 3-column table.
The columns, which may be separated by commas or tabs, should be ordered
as follows: Term string, Definition, and Examples. You can help us maintain
a high-quality metadictionary and minimize redundancies by searching for your
term. Take a look at our <a href="/guidelines">community guidelines</a> for best
