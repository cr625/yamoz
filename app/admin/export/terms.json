A change in the amount of stored energy, due for example to the advection or conduction of heat or the absorption or emission of radiation, will result in a change in the temperature or the phase, or both, of the material in the volume. Phase changes, in particular melting and freezing but also sublimation and deposition, couple the energy balance strongly to the mass balance. For example they determine the amount of ablation by melting and sublimation, and so the energy balance must be determined using either an energy-balance model or a temperature-index model in any attempt to model ablation. The surface energy balance is that of an interface or degenerate volume, the thickness of which approaches zero, at the surface of the glacier. Glaciers also have internal and basal energy balances. In cold glaciers and some polythermal glaciers, the largest component of the internal energy balance is usually the heat source due to refreezing. In both the internal and basal energy balances, friction is a mechanical source of heat and heat is conducted (or advected) between adjacent volumes that are not isothermal. The geothermal heat flux is usually a significant term in the basal energy balance and basal mass balance of grounded ice, but the resulting contribution to the climatic-basal mass balance is generally small.

It is believed to be due primarily to the emission of the nitrogen molecule N2, its molecular ion N2+, and atomic oxygen [O]. According to various theories, auroras seem definitely to be related to magnetic storms and the influx of charged particles from the sun. The exact details of the nature of the mechanisms involved are still being investigated. The aurora is most intense at times of magnetic storms (when it is also observed farthest equatorward) and shows a periodicity related to the sun's 27-day rotation period and the 11-year sunspot cycle. The distribution with height shows a pronounced maximum near 100 km. The lower limit is probably near 80 km. The aurora can often be clearly seen, and it assumes a variety of shapes and colors that are characteristic patterns of auroral emission. The names given to the various forms are 1) arcs, which are bands of light extending across the sky, the highest point of the arc being in the direction of the magnetic meridian; 2) rays, which may appear as single lines like a searchlight beam, or in bundles; 3) draperies, which have a curtainlike appearance, sharp on the bottom and tenuous in the upper parts; 4) crown or corona, which are seen when the rays appear to spread out from a single point in the sky; 5) bands, which are similar to the arcs, and may or may not have a ray structure; and 6) diffuse luminous surfaces, which appear as luminous clouds of indefinite shape.

Four processes are generally distinguished: 1) deposition (sorption; previously called sublimation), where the ice phase forms directly from water vapor; 2) condensation freezing, where the ice phase forms in a supercooled solution following growth and dilution of a cloud condensation nucleus; 3) contact freezing, where a supercooled droplet nucleates following contact of an ice nucleating aerosol; 4) immersion freezing, where the nucleating particle is completely immersed in the supercooled liquid, which nucleates with sufficient cooling. Because of this multiplicity of nucleation mechanisms it is often difficult to deduce the processes active in a given cloud. Artificially generated aerosols such as silver iodide show activity by all four mechanisms, but at different rates.

        "definition": "The dimension of mass balance is [M] (mass). The dimension of the mass-balance rate is [M T-1] (mass per unit time). When the mass balance is presented per unit area, it is called specific mass balance and its dimension becomes [M L-2], while the dimension of the mass-balance rate becomes [M L-2 T-1]. When water-equivalent units are adopted (see below), the dimension becomes [L3] or [L3T-1], the corresponding specific units being [L] or [L T-1]. The unit for expressing mass or change of mass numerically is the kilogram (kg). When more convenient the petagram (Pg) or gigatonne (Gt; 1 Gt = 1 Pg = 1012 kg) can be substituted. When mass balance is expressed per unit area, its unit is kg m-2. The unit kg m-2 is usually replaced by the millimetre water equivalent, mm w. E. This substitution is convenient because 1 kg of liquid water, of density 1000 kg m-3, has a vertical extent of exactly 1 mm when distributed uniformly over a horizontal area of 1 m2. The units kg m-2 and mm w. E. Are therefore numerically identical. More formally, the metre water equivalent (m w. E.) Is an extension of the SI that is obtained by dividing a particular mass per unit area by the density of water, w: 1 m w. E. = 1000 kg m-2 / w: Because of the risk of confusion with the metre ice equivalent, or with ordinary lengths, it is important that the qualifier 'w. E.' Not be omitted. Mass balances can also be stated in m3 w. E. (1 m3 w. E. = 1 m w. E. Distributed uniformly over 1 m2) or km3 w. E. Note that 1 km3 w. E. Is numerically identical with 1 Gt. For the mass-balance rate, appropriate units are kg a-1 or kg m-2 a-1 (or m3 w. E. A-1 or mm w. E. A-1) when the time span is an integer multiple of 1 year. Over shorter intervals the unit of time should be the second or the day. Mass units (kg or m3 w. E.) Are useful for hydrological and oceanographic purposes, while specific mass units (kg m-2, mm w. E., m w. E.) Are needed when comparing the mass balances of different glaciers and for studying glacier-climate relations. To convert, with sufficient accuracy for many purposes, to the frequently needed sea-level equivalent (SLE), mass balance in kg m-2 is first converted to kg by multiplying by the area of the glacier, and then divided by the product of w and the area of the ocean (362.5 1012 m2). The sign of SLE is opposite to that of glacier mass balance, a loss from the ice being deemed to be an equivalent gain for the ocean. #{g: xqIHPGlacierMassBalance | h1629}\n\n#{g: xqGCW | h1619}",

A synthetic aperture radar (SAR) consists of a side-looking radar system that takes advantage of the forward motion of the radar platform to synthesize a very long antenna, enabling a much higher ground resolution than in ordinary radar altimetry. Each SAR acquisition contains information on the amplitude and phase of the radiation reflected from the target and received at the antenna. Interferometric SAR requires the calculation of differences in phase between two co-registered SAR images obtained with slightly different viewing geometries, either at the same time from two antennae, or at two different times from one antenna. These phase differences yield fringe patterns (interferograms) that are an expression of both surface topography and surface motion. If the surface is not in motion, or the time between images is sufficiently short, phase differences can be converted to surface elevations with knowledge of the attitude and orbital position of the interferometer; more specifically, the baseline length, or distance between the two orbital positions, must be known. Using insar to detect motion of the surface requires imagery from two different epochs (repeat pass interferometry).In this case topographic effects are removed using an independently derived digital elevation model. #{g: xqIHPGlacierMassBalance | h1629}\n\n#{g: xqGCW | h1619}",

Thickness can change at a point due to ablation and accumulation at the surface and bottom of the glacier, compaction of snow and firn, or a non-zero emergence velocity or submergence velocity. Thickness change is often used interchangeably with elevation change, but the two are not necessarily the same. For example, elevation can change due to glacial isostatic adjustment or vertical tectonic motions, without a change in glacier thickness. The thickness change at a point is not equivalent to the climatic-basal mass balance at that point because the thickness change may be due in part to emergence or submergence. Thickness change at a point is therefore not a direct indicator of the local climate. The glacier-wide mean thickness change is the volume change of the entire glacier divided by the mean glacier area during the time span of the measurements: 2(h V VS S 21)/(21) , where V is volume, S is area, and subscripts 1 and 2 refer to measurements at an earlier and later time, respectively. The quantity 21( ) V V V is the volume change. Usually the two volumes are not known separately, and: V is obtained from measurements of by geodetic methods.

Aircraft systems measure the altimeter trajectory using GPS and inertial navigation systems. Accurate altimetry measurements, especially those acquired from space, require corrections for variations in atmospheric and ionospheric conditions, and for variations in orbital position of the sensor. Altimeters are either laser altimeters or radar altimeters. Each of the two radiation bands has strengths and weaknesses with respect to footprint size and ability to sample through atmospheric obstructions such as clouds. Altimetry measurements are compared with surface elevations obtained at identical points in horizontal space at an earlier time to calculate elevation changes which can then be used to compute volume changes. The earlier elevation measurement is commonly obtained from a previous altimetry pass, but can also be derived from other sources such as topographic maps.

        "definition": "The difference between accumulation and ablation on a glacier; usually calculated on an annual basis. #{g: xqNSIDCCryosphere | h1635}\n\nMass balance describes the net gain or loss of snow and ice through a given year. It is usually expressed in terms of water gain or loss. #{g: xqUSGSGlaciers(ambiguous) | -}\n\nA measure of the change in mass of a glacier at a certain point for a specific period of time. The balance between accumulation and ablation. Also called Mass Budget. #{g: xqUSGSGlaciers(ambiguous) | -}\n\nThe change in the mass of a glacier, or part of the glacier, over a stated span of time; the term mass budget is a synonym. See mass-balance units for recommended units. The span of time is often a year or a season. A seasonal mass balance is nearly always either a winter balance or a summer balance, although other kinds of season are appropriate in some climates, such as those of the tropics. The definition of year depends on the method adopted for measurement of the balance. See time system. The reference in the definition to a glacier means that a particular volume of space is being studied. A properly delineated glacier has no mass transfer of ice across its boundary other than as ice discharge. However, the mass balance is often quoted for volumes other than that of the whole glacier, for example a column through the glacier, the part of the glacier upglacier or downglacier from the grounding line, or a band defined by two contours of surface elevation. It is necessary in such cases to make clear that the study volume is something other than the whole glacier, and also to make clear which components of the mass balance are being reported. The quantity reported may be the climatic mass balance or the climatic-basal mass balance, but will often be the surface mass balance. In all cases the need for a defined study volume is fundamental because without it the principle of conservation of mass cannot be invoked. The study volume may change over the study period. The surface and bed elevations may change, and the areal extent is unlikely to be the same at the end of the period as it was at the beginning. Whether these changes are significant will depend not just on their magnitude and the accuracy with which they can be determined but on the purpose of the investigation. See conventional balance, reference-surface balance. #{g: xqIHPGlacierMassBalance | h1629}\n\n(1) In a hydrosystem, equivalence between the total mass of water entering the system and that leaving the system. (2) The necessary condition in a chemical reaction for mass conservation of each element regardless of the component in which the element participates. #{g: xqWMOHydrology | h1642}\n\n(or mass budget) A year-by-year measure of the state of health of a glacier, reflecting the balance between accumulation and ablation. A glacier with a positive mass balance in a particular year gained more mass through accumulation than was lost through ablation; the reverse is true for negative mass balance. #{g: xqSwisseduc | h1638}\n\nUsually, a model that employs the limitation that the system observed maintains a constant mass, that is, total mass divergence for the entire system is zero, but may be nonzero within the system. #{g: xqAMSglossary | h1620}\n\nThe relative balance between the input and output of material within a system. #{g: xqPhysicalGeography | h1636}\n\nThe balance between the mass input to the ice body (accumulation) and the mass loss (ablation and iceberg calving) over a stated period of time, which is often a year or a season. Point mass balance refers to the mass balance at a particular location on the glacier or ice sheet. Surface mass balance is the difference between surface accumulation and surface ablation. The input and output terms for mass balance are: Accumulation All processes that add to the mass of a glacier. The main contribution to accumulation is snowfall. Accumulation also includes deposition of hoar, freezing rain, other types of solid precipitation, gain of wind-blown snow, and avalanching. Ablation Surface processes that reduce the mass of a glacier. The main contributor to ablation is melting with runoff but on some glaciers sublimation, loss of wind-blown snow and avalanching are also significant processes of ablation. Discharge/outflow Mass loss by iceberg calving or ice discharge across the grounding line of a floating ice shelf. Although often treated as an ablation term, in this report iceberg calving and discharge is considered separately from surface ablation.

The general water balance equation is W = P E Q , where P is precipitation, E is evapotranspiration, Q is runoff and W is the change in storage. The water balance is the basis of the hydrological method of determination of glacier mass balance. Typically in glaciological research the defined volume is a drainage basin tributary to a discharge measurement station near to the glacier margin, and not all of the basin is glacierized. Transfers of water by precipitation and evapotranspiration will include transfers not passing through the boundary of the glacier, and stores of water will include lakes, seasonal snowpatches, soil and aquifers as well as the glacier. Changes in each of the non-glacial stores must be accounted for to isolate the glacier mass balance. It can be convenient in glacier hydrology to distinguish between meltwater runoff from glacier iceand firn and runoff from the basin-wide snowpack, the latter including the snow on the glacier. Denoting these stores by I and N respectively, and assuming that changes in other stores are negligible, I = N Ei qin = Pn En Qn. #{g: xqIHPGlacierMassBalance | h1629}\n\n#{g: xqGCW | h1619}",

        "definition": "A regional downslope wind whose source is so cold that it is experienced as a cold wind, despite compression warming as it descends the lee slope of a mountain range. #{g: xqNOAA-NWS | h1633}\n\nA fall wind with a source so cold that, when the air reaches the lowlands or coast, the dynamic warming is insufficient to raise the air temperature to the normal level for the region; hence it appears as a cold wind. The terms borino and boraccia denote a weak bora and a strong bora, respectively. The term was originally applied (along with karstbora) to the cold northeast wind on the Dalmatian coast of Croatia and Bosnia in winter when cold air from Russia crosses the mountains and descends to the relatively warm coast of the Adriatic. According to Smith (1987), the bora \"has often been considered the prototype fall wind,\" although recent studies have revealed that some boras have downslope windstorm or hydraulic jump structure. The event often lasts a day or less, although extended events occur with enough frequency that \"the longevity of the bora is one of its primary characteristics. A duration of four to six days is not unusual.\" It is very stormy and squally, the squalls sometimes reaching 50 m s-1 or more. F. Defant (1951) distinguishes between cyclonic bora (bora scura) with clouds and rain, covering the whole Adriatic and occurring with a depression over southern Adria, and the dry anticyclonic bora, with a powerful anticyclone over central Europe extending over Dalmatia; the latter is very violent over the land but extends only a short distance out to sea. A local bora also occurs on the east coast of the Adriatic with a cold anticyclone over the Balkans. The term bora is now applied to similar winds in other parts of the world. Well-known examples occur at Novorossiisk on the northern shore of the Black Sea, and in Novaya Zemlya (islands in the Russian Arctic). A squally katabatic wind at Alme Dagh in the Gulf of Iskenderon (eastern Mediterranean Sea) is termed rageas (also ragut, ghaziyah). The Bulgarian term is buria. In some mountainous regions of the world bora has been further generalized to represent any large mesoscale or synoptic-scale downslope flow of cold air, including post- arctic-frontal fall winds and cold-air downslope windstorms, which may have a hydraulic jump- like character and structure. In the case of downslope windstorms, some authors have used bora for a cold-advection flow (or one that results in cooling to the immediate lee of the mountain barrier), whereas chinook or foehn refer to a warm- or neutral-advection wind (or one that results in warming or no temperature change leeward of the barrier). Those who have attempted to classify downslope windstorms, however, have found that many cases do not fall neatly into one category or the other. #{g: xqAMSglossary | h1620}\n\nTerm used to describe a katabatic wind in Yugoslavia. #{g: xqPhysicalGeography | h1636}\n\n#{g: xqGCW | h1619}",

They occur at heights about 20-30 km above the earth. These clouds are rarely seen, and it would appear that they can be observed only in certain regions. They have been observed mainly over Antarctica due to the lower temperatures present there in the circumpolar vortex. They also form over Scotland and Scandinavia in winter during periods with an intense, broad, deep, and homogeneous westerly to northwesterly flow of air over northern Europe; they are also observed in Alaska. Less frequent sightings have been reported at lower latitudes. The simultaneous occurrence of various colors of the spectrum in more or less irregular patterns strongly suggests diffraction by spherical particles. The exact physical constitution of cloud particles has been determined by aircraft (e.g., the NASA ER2 aircraft) penetration showing the presence of nitric acid hydrates (in particular nitric acid tri-hydrate, type I) with the addition of water ice at temperatures a few degrees lower (type II). Nuclei for clouds are thought to be sulfuric acid aerosol, possibly of volcanic origin. The clouds form in regions where dynamic lifting or radiational cooling lowers the air to temperatures below saturation for these different constituents (about 95C). PSC are thought to play a major role in the formation of the \"ozone hole\" because they absorb odd nitrogen from the atmosphere, which allows the catalytic destruction of ozone to occur. Nacreous clouds appear stationary and, by day, often resemble pale cirrus. At sunset, all the colors of the spectrum appear; as the sky darkens after sunset, they increase in brilliance. As the sun drops lower and lower below the horizon and the clouds are lighted by last rays, the various colors are replaced by a general coloration that is first orange and then becomes pink, contrasting vividly with the darkening sky. The clouds next become gray and the colors of the spectrum reappear but very weakly, then fade out rapidly. Later, up until about two hours after sunset, the nacreous clouds can still be distinguished standing out against the starry sky as tenuous and gray clouds. They can even be observed all night if there is moonlight. Before dawn, the same series of aspects appear, but in reverse order.

These minima are usually reached at different times in successive years, and the duration of the mass-balance year may therefore vary irregularly and substantially in duration from year to year. Point mass balances can be determined unambiguously in the stratigraphic system, but glacier-wide determinations require the assumption that the diachronous character of the summer surface can be neglected. In the fixed-date system the first day of the mass-balance year is always on the same calendar date, which is typically chosen to coincide with the start of the local hydrological year, for example 1 October in the mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere or 1 April in the mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, or sometimes with the average date of minimum Annual mass. The mass-balance year is 365 (or 366) days long. In the floating-date system the mass-balance year is defined by the calendar dates of the two successive surveys, which may vary from year to year and may or may not be 365 (or 366) days apart. #{g: xqIHPGlacierMassBalance | h1629}\n\n#{g: xqGCW | h1619}",

Taliks may have temperatures above 0C (non-cryotic) or below 0C (cryotic). Some Taliks may be affected by seasonal freezing. Several types of Taliks can be distinguished on the basis of their relationship to the Permafrost (closed, open, lateral, isolated and transient Taliks), and on the basis of the mechanism responsible for their unfrozen condition (hydrochemical, hydrothermal and thermal Taliks): _ Closed Talik - a non-cryotic Talik occupying a depression in the Permafrost Table below a lake or river (also called 'lake Talik' and 'river Talik'); its temperature remains above 0C because of the heat storage effect of the surface water; Hydrochemical Talik - a cryotic Talik in which freezing is prevented by mineralized groundwater flowing through the Talik. _ Hydrothermal Talik - a non-cryotic Talik, the temperature of which is maintained above 0C by the heat supplied by groundwater flowing through the Talik; _ Isolated Talik - a Talik entirely surrounded by perennially Frozen Ground; usually cryotic, but may be non-cryotic; _ Lateral Talik - a Talik overlain and underlain by perennially Frozen Ground; can be noncryotic or cryotic; _ Open Talik - a Talik that penetrates the Permafrost completely, connecting supraPermafrost and Subpermafrost Water. It may be non-cryotic or cryotic. _ Thermal Talik - a non-cryotic Talik, the temperature of which is above 0C due to the local thermal regime of the ground; _ Transient Talik - a Talik that is gradually being eliminated by freezing. #{g: xqTrombottoGeocryology | h1639}\n\nA Russian term applied to permanently unfrozen ground in regions of permafrost. (Also called tabetisol.) This usually applies to a layer that lies above the permafrost but below the active layer, that is, when the permafrost table is deeper than the depth reached by winter freezing from the surface. Talik is also found within and beneath permafrost; when it occurs beneath the permafrost it is equivalent to subgelisol. #{g: xqAMSglossary | h1620}\n\nAn unfrozen section of ground found above, below, or within a layer of discontinuous permafrost.

(2) The mass lost by the operation of any of the processes of sense 1, expressed as a negative number. The main processes of ablation are melting and calving (or, when the glacier nourishes an ice shelf, ice discharge across the grounding line). On some glaciers sublimation, loss of windborne snow and avalanching are significant processes of ablation. 'Ablation', unqualified, is sometimes used as if it were a synonym of surface ablation, although internal ablation, basal ablation, and frontal ablation, especially calving, can all be significant in some contexts. #{g: xqIHPGlacierMassBalance | h1629}\n\nAblation refers to all processes by which snow, ice, or water in any form are lost from a glacier. Ablation is the loss of snow or ice by evaporation and melting. The rate at which ablation occurs depends on the atmospheric conditions present, such as air moisture content, solar radiation, temperature, and the reflectivity (Albedo) of the snow or ice surface. Fresh snow has a high albedo (0.7 to 0.9), indicating that 70 to 90 percent of the radiation received is reflected; glacier ice has a lower albedo of 0.2 to 0.4. Therefore, more radiation may be absorbed by glacier ice than by snow. Glaciers around the mountain receive different amounts of sunlight, so each glacier has its own characteristic ablation pattern. #{g: xqUSGSGlaciers(ambiguous) | -}\n\nThe loss of ice and snow from a glacier system.

On most glaciers there are no thickness measurements at all and the thickness must be estimated, for example by volume-area scaling or as a function of surface slope and estimated basal shear stress. The definition of thickness as a vertical distance is adopted almost invariably in studies of mass balance, but not in all branches of cryospheric science. For example Fierz et al.

(Some of the other forms have very unusual properties, ice VII, for example, being stable only at pressures above 22 400 kg/cm^2, but then existing at temperatures up to about 100C.) Ice has an open structure because the water molecules bond to their neighbors covalently only in four directions; it therefore floats on higher density water, where broken molecular bonds permit closer packing. All commonly occurring forms of ice are crystalline, although large single crystals are relatively rare except in glaciers. The ice crystal lattice possesses hexagonal symmetry that manifests itself in the gross forms of such single crystals as are sometimes found in snow. At an air pressure of one atmosphere, ice melts at 0C by definition of the Celsius temperature scale. (Strictly at equilibrium among water, ice, and vapor occurs at +0.01C, the triple point.)

A profiling system is nadir-pointing, while a scanning system uses a rotating mirror, or a series of sensors arrayed in a parallel (push broom) configuration, to obtain a swath rather than a linear profile of measurements. The Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (icesat, 20032010) measured surface elevations with approximately 70 m footprint and 170 m along-track spacing. Adjacent tracks are separated by a few to a few tens of kilometres, the lesser separations being found at the polar extremities of the orbit. Sources of error include sensor saturation, atmospheric scattering effects, and inaccurate knowledge of the laser pointing angles. Aircraft altimeters have footprints of 1 m or smaller and along-track spacing on the order of 1 to 3 m, and are less affected by atmospheric and pointing errors. Laser altimeters are unable to obtain measurements through clouds. Laser is an acronym standing for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation.

        "definition": "Abnormally fast flow of a glacier over a period of a few months to years, during which the glacier margin may advance substantially. A surge-type glacier exhibits quiescent phases, typically lasting some decades, during which velocities are lower than in a 'normal', non-surge-type glacier. The ice discharge is thus too small to maintain the longitudinal profile of the glacier, which thickens in its upper reaches and thins in its lower reaches. Surges recur at quasi-periodic, glacier-specific intervals, and transfer large quantities of ice from the thickened upper part to the thinned lower part. Velocities during the surge are often greater by an order of magnitude than those during the quiescent phase. A surge-type glacier will almost always be out of balance. That is, a surge-type glacier cannot be in steady state. Surge-type glaciers may end on land or in water, and the proportion of glaciers that are of surge type varies from region to region. The mechanism of surging is poorly understood. Surges seem, however, to be related to changes in the subglacial hydrological regime and not primarily to climatic fluctuations. Although surging is best documented on smaller glaciers, many larger outlet glaciers of ice caps have been observed to surge, and there may be a connection with the unsteady behaviour exhibited by some ice streams. #{g: xqIHPGlacierMassBalance | h1629}\n\nA short-lived, frequently large-scale, increase in the rate of movement of the ice within a glacier.

The warm phases of these events correspond to interstadials, persist for a few hundred to a few thousand years, and have very rapid onset and termination (as little as a few decades). The range of temperature change inferred for the regions where the snow was formed that ultimately produced the Greenland ice was several degrees Celsius. Named for the ice core paleoclimatologists Willi Dansgaard and Hans Oeschger, Dansgaard-Oeschger events between 80 000 and 20 000 years ago are grouped in 10 000- to 15 000-year periods of increasing cooling. The ending of each of these groups of events is marked by a major flux of icebergs into the North Atlantic, as evidenced by associated material found in ocean floor sediments. The temperature conditions in Greenland and the North Atlantic region then return to the higher level of the beginning of the group of Dansgaard-Oeschger events. Most of the Dansgaard-Oeschger events that lasted 2000 years or more coincide with warmer conditions in East Antarctica, also revealed by analysis of oxygen isotopes in ice. #{g: xqAMSglossary | h1620}\n\n#{g: xqGCW | h1619}",

Air in the valley thus becomes cooler than air at the same level over the adjacent plain ( see topographic amplification factor), producing higher pressure in the valley. The pressure gradient drives a downvalley wind that begins one to four hours after sunset, persists for the rest of the night until after sunrise, and often reaches 7-10 m s-1 or more above the surface. The downvalley wind tends to fill the valley, that is, its depth is approximately the depth of the valley, and where mountains end and a valley empties onto the plains, the downvalley wind can become a cold-air valley outflow jet flowing out of the mouth of the valley.

In this sense, which prevails almost universally in the study of mass balance, snow may contain ice in the form of lenses or pipes which are the result of refreezing of meltwater. (3) An accumulation of solid precipitation on a glacier that has not yet attained a density through compaction sufficient to restrict the circulation of air and water significantly.

The essence of the method is that measured changes in the exposed length of the cable (or equivalent measurements of the local surface mass balance), and in the surface elevation (measured by the GNSS receiver), yield two of the three terms in the continuity equation and allow the third term, the submergence or emergence velocity (that is, the flux divergence) to be determined. Corrections may be needed for the densification (that is, settling) of firn beneath the anchor and for downslope advection of the anchor. The coffee-can method has been used mainly in the accumulation zones of ice sheets, where the surface mass balance can be obtained by ice-core stratigraphy. However in the ablation zone the emergence of cables emplaced for other reasons, such as the measurement of temperature profiles, can serve a similar purpose. #{g: xqIHPGlacierMassBalance | h1629}\n\n#{g: xqGCW | h1619}",

(2) Structurally, the metamorphic stage intermediate between snow and ice, in which the pore space is at least partially interconnected, allowing air and water to circulate; typical densities are 400830 kg m3. In this sense, the firn is generally up to a few tens of metres thick on a temperate glacier that is close to a steady state, and up to or more than 100 m thick in the dry snow zone on the ice sheets. #{g: xqIHPGlacierMassBalance | h1629}\n\nOld snow that has recrystallized into a dense material.

Snow becomes firn when it has been compressed so that no pore space remains between flakes or crystals, a process that takes less than a year. #{g: xqUSGSGlaciers(ambiguous) | -}\n\nOld snow which has become granular and dense under the action of various processes of melting and refreezing, including sublimation and crystallization. #{g: xqWMOHydrology | h1642}\n\n(from the German) Dense, old snow in which the crystals are partly joined together, but in which the air pockets still communicate with each other. It has a sugary texture. #{g: xqSwisseduc | h1638}\n\nOld snow that has become granular and compacted (dense) as the result of various surface metamorphoses, mainly melting and refreezing but also including sublimation. The resulting particles are generally spherical and rather uniform. Firnification, the process of firn formation, is the first step in the transformation of snow into land ice (usually glacier ice). Some authorities restrict the use of firn to snow that has lasted through one summer, thereby distinguishing it from spring snow. Originally, the French term, \"n v ,\" was equivalent to the German term, \"firn,\" but there is a growing tendency, especially among British glaciologists, to use \"n v s\" for an area of firn, that is, generally for the accumulation area above or at the head of a glacier. #{g: xqAMSglossary | h1620}\n\nNeve on a glacier that survives the year's ablation season.

The units in which a quantity is reported make clear whether or not it is specific. Specific mass balance may be reported for a point on the surface, a column of unit cross-section, or a larger volume such as an entire glacier or a collection of glaciers. In the latter two cases the term 'mean specific mass balance' has been used, although the adjective 'mean' is also not necessary. The definition of 'specific' apparently offered by Meier (1962) has led to some confusion. He wrote... Quantities measured at a point will first be discussed. [They] should all be prefaced by the word specific ...Specific budget terms have dimensions of [length] or [length]/[time]. The confusion arises because of the primacy given by Meier to water-equivalent dimensions ('[length]'). The adjective 'specific' indicates that the quantity has dimension [M L-2] or [M L-2 T-1], not that it is being measured at a point. The adjective 'point', as in point mass balance, should be used when clarity is needed. The unit of area lies in the horizontal plane, not a plane parallel to the glacier surface. For mass-balance purposes this rule applies even when the surface is vertical. For example, at a calving front the frontal ablation is equal to the mass of the entire volume lost by calving, melting and sublimation. If quoted as a specific quantity it is divided by the horizontal area over which the balance is to be stated, such as that of the entire glacier for a glacier-wide mass balance. The glaciological usage is not that which prevails in some other sciences, where often a specific quantity is either a dimensionless ratio of the value of a property of a given substance to the value of the same property of some reference substance, or is a quantity expressed per unit mass. #{g: xqIHPGlacierMassBalance | h1629}\n\n#{g: xqGCW | h1619}",

(2) Solid precipitation that has accumulated on the summer surface on a glacier and that transforms to firn at the end of the mass-balance year. See zone. In this sense, which prevails almost universally in the study of mass balance, snow may contain ice in the form of lenses or pipes which are the result of refreezing of meltwater. (3) An accumulation of solid precipitation on a glacier that has not yet attained a density through compaction sufficient to restrict the circulation of air and water significantly. In this structural sense, the dividing line between snow and firn is diffuse but is conventionally taken to be near to a density of 400 kg m-3. #{g: xqIHPGlacierMassBalance | h1629}\n\nPrecipitation in the form of ice crystals, mainly of intricately branched, hexagonal form and often agglomerated into snowflakes, formed directly from the freezing [deposition] of the water vapor in the air. #{g: xqNOAA-NWS | h1633}\n\nPrecipitation in the form of small ice crystals which may fall singly or in flakes.

For weather-observing purposes, the intensity of snow is characterized as 1) light when the visibility is 1 km (5/8 statute mile) or more; 2) moderate when the visibility is less than 1 km (5/8 statute mile) but not more than 1/2 km (5/16 statute mile); and 3) heavy when the visibility is less than 1/2 km (5/16 statute mile). #{g: xqAMSglossary | h1620}\n\nA type of solid precipitation that forms in clouds with an air temperature below freezing. Snow forms when water vapor deposits directly as a solid on a deposition nuclei. Snowflakes begin their life as very tiny crystals developing on a six-sided hexagonal deposition nuclei. The developing snowflak, then grows fastest at the six points of the nuclei as these surfaces are more exposed to atmosphere's water vapor. Snowfall is most common with the frontal lifting associated with mid-latitude cyclones during fall, winter, and spring months when air temperatures are below freezing. #{g: xqPhysicalGeography | h1636}\n\nPrecipitation of ice crystals, most of which are branched (sometimes star-shaped).

At the base of grounded temperate ice, melting is either fuelled by the geothermal heat flux and the conversion of the kinetic energy of basal sliding to heat, or results from variations of the pressure-melting point. Pressure melting, however, tends to be balanced by regelation. Typical continental geothermal heat fluxes G of 0.050.15 W m-2 imply potential basal ablation G/Lf of 514 mm w. E. A-1, where Lf is the latent heat of fusion. Much greater geothermal heat fluxes are found in areas of Active volcanism. If all of the energy of basal sliding is converted to heat, basal ablation ubb/Lf at rates of 330 mm w. E. A-1 is implied by sliding velocities ub of 10100 m a-1 and basal shear stress b of 105 Pa. Basal ablation rates tens or hundreds of times greater are implied beneath ice streams. At the base of an ice shelf or floating tongue, melting occurs because of convection of warmer sea water to the ice-water interface, supplying the required latent heat of fusion. The rate of melting depends on the temperature of the sea water and the efficiency of the heat transfer between the seawater and the base of the ice shelf. Basal ablation rates beneath ice shelves or floating tongues can reach tens of m w. E.

The ACC is influenced by bottom topography, which causes deflections from its general westward path and eddy formation, particularly at the Scotia Ridge, the Kerguelen Plateau, and the Macquarie Ridge.

The density of dry snow increases rapidly at first, by the conversion of snowflakes to grains. Then, usually under the pressure of an increasing overburden of newer snow, density increases more slowly by settling of the grains to about 550 kg m-3, representing the maximum practically attainable packing. Snow becomes firn (in the structural sense) over a range of density beginning at about 400 kg m-3.Beyond the maximum packing density, even slower mechanisms of densification sintering and plastic deformation of the grains, and recrystallization become dominant. When the firn reaches a density of about 830 kg m-3, the pore spaces between crystals are closed off, air can no longer flow (as opposed to diffusing through the crystal lattices), and the substance is deemed to be glacier ice. When there has been no melting, densification rarely proceeds beyond 400 kg m-3 over the course of a typical mid-latitude winter. Depending on the accumulation (that is, loading) rate, glacier ice may be produced in times from a few years to a few centuries. Melting followed by refreezing can yield bulk densities near that of pure ice in times shorter than a day. #{g: xqIHPGlacierMassBalance | h1629}\n\n#{g: xqGCW | h1619}",

Glacier volume V is the product of area S and mean thickness H. Measured mean thicknesses are well described by a relation of the form H c S1, which is the basis for the volume-area relation V c S . Here c and are parameters estimated from samples of glaciers with measured thicknesses. There is good evidence, as shown by Bahr et al. (1997), that estimates of from observations are nearly consistent with theoretical expectation. Mean thickness is also sometimes estimated as a function of average surface slope and basal shear stress. Volumearea scaling is both a way of estimating regional and global glacier volumes from abundant data on glacier area, and a possible way of estimating (with large random uncertainty) the volume balance of single glaciers from successive measurements of area S1 and S2, for example as2 1 ()2(2V c S S . It can also be used, as a practical alternative to ice-flow modelling, to estimate glacier area changes in attempts to model the response of glaciers to climatic change. Glacier volume is also expected, and found, to scale with glacier length, particularly when the length is that of a flowline. #{g: xqIHPGlacierMassBalance | h1629}\n\n#{g: xqGCW | h1619}",

Evidence is accumulating for a wider, perhaps global, extent, but the Younger Dryas was most strongly felt around the North Atlantic Ocean. Changes in the thermohaline circulation of the oceans are widely believed to be implicated in the onset and ending of the Younger Dryas cooling. These were in turn associated with a switch to the St. Lawrence River as the major route for meltwater reaching the North Atlantic from the retreating continental ice cap. Other similarly rapid oscillations in climate are recorded through much of the last glacial in ice cores from Greenland and in marine sediment cores from the North Atlantic (Dansgaard-Oeschger events).

The crystal lattice of ice is hexagonal in its symmetry under most atmospheric conditions. Varying conditions of temperature and vapor pressure can lead to growth of crystalline forms in which the simple hexagonal pattern is present in widely different habits (a thin hexagonal plate or a long thin hexagonal column). In many ice crystals, trigonal symmetry can be observed, suggesting an influence of a cubic symmetry. The principal axis (c axis) of a single crystal of ice is perpendicular to the axis of hexagonal symmetry. Planes perpendicular to this axis are called basal planes (a axes related to the prism facets) and present a hexagonal cross section. Ice is anisotropic in both its optical and electrical properties and has a high dielectric constant (even higher than water) resulting from its water dipole structure. The electrical relaxation time for water is much shorter than for ice (10^9 Hz compared with 10^4 Hz), resulting from a chain reaction requirement for molecules to relax through defects in the ice lattice. In the free air, ice crystals compose cirrus-type clouds, and near the ground they form the hydrometeor called, remarkably enough, \"ice crystals\" (or ice prisms). They are one constituent of ice fog, the other constituent being droxtals. On terrestrial objects the ice crystal is the elemental unit of hoarfrost in all of its various forms. Ice crystals that form in slightly supercooled water are termed frazil. Ice originating as frozen water (e.g., hail, graupel, and lake ice) still has hexagonal symmetry but lacks any external hexagonal form. Analysis of their sections (0.5 mm) in polarized light reveals different crystal shapes and orientations, depending on the freezing and any annealing and subsequent recrystallization process. #{g: xqAMSglossary | h1620}\n\n#{g: xqGCW | h1619}",

It most commonly refers to a planetary-scale mid- to high-latitude circumpolar circulation. There are distinct tropospheric and stratospheric circumpolar vortices. The tropospheric polar vortex is usually defined by geopotential contours that lie within the core of the tropospheric westerlies.1 The tropospheric vortex edge is generally between 40\u02da and 50\u02da latitude (Fig. 1), and the vortex exists throughout the year but is strongest during winter when the air within the polar vortex is the coldest. The term 'polar vortex' is sometimes used in reference to smaller-scale (meso- to synoptic scale) vortices that usually occur within the tropospheric polar vortex in polar regions near the tropopause - for example, tropopause polar vortices. 2. The stratospheric polar vortex exists from spring to fall and usually extends from just above tropopause to the upper stratosphere (see Fig. 1). The stratospheric vortex generally increases in size from the lower stratosphere to the upper stratosphere where its edge is located around 50\u02da latitude. The stratospheric vortex breaks down, and the circumpolar flow reverses, during summer. 3. Circumpolar vortices have also been observed on other planetary bodies (e.g., Mars, Venus, Saturn, and Titan). 4. #{g: xqAMSglossary | h1620}\n\nThe large-scale cyclonic circulation in the middle and upper troposphere centred generally in the polar regions. syn. circumpolar vortex #{g: xqWMOMeteoterm | h1643}\n\n#{g: xqGCW | h1619}",

In these usages 'net' has its plain-language meaning, referring to the change of mass after all deductions (here ablation) have been made. To resolve this ambiguity, it is recommended that the original definition of 'net mass balance' be retired, and that i) Annual mass balance be used instead for the mass balance over a mass-balance year in any time system; and ii) explicit information about the time system be given as metadata whenever it is relevant (as it is for all measurements by the glaciological method). The adjective 'net' thus becomes a plain-language word, and in many cases becomes redundant because the meaning of 'balance' includes the meaning of 'net'. #{g: xqIHPGlacierMassBalance | h1629}\n\n#{g: xqGCW | h1619}",

In nature, heterogeneous nucleation is the more common where such a change takes place on small particles of different composition and structure. Homogeneous nucleation occurs when the change of state centers upon embryos that exist in the same initial state as the changing substance. In this case, the nucleation system contains only one component, and it is termed homogeneous nucleation. In meteorology, particularly in cloud physics, a number of types of nucleation are of interest. The process by which cloud condensation nuclei initiate the phase change from vapor to liquid is important in all cloud formation problems. The physical nature of freezing nuclei that may be responsible for the conversion of drops of supercooled water into ice crystals is critically important in precipitation theory, as is the clarification of the role of homogeneous nucleation near -40C.

Response times have been formulated for various attributes of the glacier such as volume and length. They can be confused easily with the mass-turnover time; the reaction time; and the growth time. The volumetric response time is the most commonly seen formulation. Here the glacier changes from an initial volume V1 to a later volume V2, and the response time is the time needed for the volume to change by (V2 V1) (1 e-1), where e = 2.71828... Is the base of natural logarithms. The response time is much shorter than the time required to attain volume V2. Indeed, in this formulation the time to attain volume V2 is infinite. The change between state 1 and state 2 is assumed to be 'small'. The response time for volume is somewhat shorter than that for length, that is, for the length to change by (L2 L1) (1 e-1). The response time is an idealization. The essence of the idea is that the glacier 'remembers' its earlier steady state because it adjusts its size and shape by flow.

        "definition": "A radar designed to measure microwave backscattering, quantified as the scattering coefficient or normalized radar cross section 0, from natural media. Exposed glacier ice in the ablation zone lacks a distinctive mass-balance-related signature at microwave wavelengths. In the percolation zone, subsurface ice lenses are strong scatterers, but there is a sharp reduction in backscattering when meltwater appears at the surface. When wet, the surface becomes a more nearly specular (forward) reflector and appears radar-dark instead of radar-bright. In the dry-snow zone radar returns are unaffected by liquid water, which is absent, and the scattering coefficient contains information on snow grain size and possibly on the accumulation rate. Scatterometers have relatively poor spatial resolution (several to some tens of kilometres), which can be improved by temporal averaging, but they compensate by offering wide and frequent coverage. Seawinds, on the polar-orbiting quikscat satellite (1999-2009) has been a productive scatterometer. Intended for the measurement of ocean-surface wind speeds, it has also proved valuable for measuring the extent and duration of melting on ice caps and ice sheets.

(2) Orographic snowline: lowest altitude at which snow persists on the land surface as isolated coverings on the mountains in summer. #{g: xqWMOHydrology | h1642}\n\nA set of points forming the lower limit of a snow-covered area; on a glacier, the line separating snow surfaces from ice or firn surfaces, and also separating the percolation zone from either the superimposed ice zone or the ablation zone (see also zone). The set of points need not form a continuous curve. The snow-covered area of the glacier may include outliers (isolated patches of snow surrounded by firn or ice) and may exclude inliers (isolated patches of exposed firn or ice). The snowline is usually easy to see, because the snow above it is brighter than the firn or ice below it. It may therefore be mapped by analysis of suitable imagery. When, and only when, there is no superimposed ice, the snowline coincides with the equilibrium line. Unless qualified by a different adjective, references to the snowline are understood to refer to the Annual snowline. It is common for 'snowline' to be used as an abbreviation of 'average altitude of the snowline'. #{g: xqIHPGlacierMassBalance | h1629}\n\nIn general the outer boundary of a snow covered area.

The question of the maintenance of the jet stream is a cardinal problem of theoretical meteorology. Two such jet streams are sometimes distinguished. The predominant one, the polar-front jet stream, is associated with the polar front of middle and upper-middle latitudes. Very loosely, it may be said to extend around the hemisphere, but, like the polar front, it is discontinuous and varies greatly from day to day. A subtropical jet stream is found, at some longitudes, between 20 and 30 latitude and is strongest off the Asian coast.

        "definition": "Name given to cold northerly, northeasterly, or easterly, postfrontal winds in the Swiss Middleland (the region between the Jura and the Alps) and in various regions of eastern France. The bise is typically driven by an anticyclone building to the northwest or north of the Alps. According to Wanner and Furger (1990), \"the cold air flow from the north and northeast is channeled between the Jura and the Alps and leads to the formation of the bise over the Swiss Middleland and the upper Rh\u00f4ne Valley. Thus, the bise is normally a postfrontal phenomenon and is closely connected with the advection of cold and dry continental air. Typically the classic bise endures about one to three days.\" The bise is most frequent in spring, when it usually brings fine, bright weather. In winter a special case of the bise occurs when the pressure gradient is produced by a Mediterranean cyclone system to the south of the Alps, bringing moist air in from the Balkans. Accompanied by heavy clouds, snow whirlwinds in the mountains, and rain, snow, or hail, this wind is called a \"black bise\" (bise noire in Switzerland and Sa\u00f4ne in east central France; bise n\u00e8gre in Aveyron in south central France). In spring the bise can last for several days and bring damaging frosts. In the Morvan in east central France the very dry bise in March is termed hale de mars (drying wind of March). In the Dr\u00f4me Valley southeast of Valence (southeast France) the name bise brume is given to a moist, mild, and sometimes foggy wind from the northwest.

Frost Action in fine-grained soils increases the volume of the soil not only by freezing of in situ pore water (9% expansion) but also by drawing water to the Freezing Front where Ice lenses form. Soils that have undergone substantial heaving may consist of alternate layers of Ice-saturated soil and relatively clear Ice lenses. The lenses are formed normal to the direction of heat flow and when freezing penetrates from the ground surface (which may be horizontal, sloping or vertical), they form parallel to that surface. When unrestrained, the amount of surface heave may be almost as much as the total thickness of the Ice lenses. Frost Heave can occur seasonally or continuously if freezing of the ground proceeds without interruption over a period of years. Differential, or non-uniform, frost heaving is one of the main aspects of the Frost Action process and reflects the heterogeneous nature of most soils, or variations in heat removal rate and groundwater supply over short distances. Depending on the degree of restraint, large Freezing Pressures (up to 1 MPa) can be developed as the ground freezes. #{g: xqTrombottoGeocryology | h1639}\n\n#{g: xqGCW | h1619}",

It occurs at very low temperatures, and usually in clear, calm weather in high latitudes. The sun is usually visible and may cause halo phenomena. Ice fog is rare at temperatures warmer than -30C, and increases in frequency with decreasing temperature until it is almost always present at air temperatures of -45C in the vicinity of a source of water vapor. Such sources are the open water of fast-flowing streams or of the sea, herds of animals, volcanoes, and especially products of combustion for heating or propulsion. At temperatures warmer than -30C, these sources can cause steam fog of liquid water droplets, which may turn into ice fog when cooled ( see frost smoke).

The wind is associated with surface cooling of the slope. #{g: xqAustraliaBoM | h1622}\n\n1. Most widely used in mountain meteorology to denote a downslope flow driven by cooling at the slope surface during periods of light larger-scale winds; the nocturnal component of the along-slope wind systems. The surface cools a vertical column of the atmosphere starting at the slope surface and reaching perhaps 10-100 m deep. This column is colder than the column at equivalent levels over the valley or plain, resulting in a hydrostatic pressure excess over the slope relative to over the valley or plain. The horizontal pressure gradient, maximized at the slope surface, drives an acceleration directed away from the slope, or downslope. Although the pressure-gradient forcing is at its maximum at the slope, surface friction causes the peak in the katabatic wind speeds to occur above the surface, usually by a few meters to a few tens of meters. The depth of the downslope flow layer on simple slopes has been found to be 0.05 times the vertical drop from the top of the slope. Surface-wind speeds in mountain-valley katabatic flows are often 3-4 m/s, but on long slopes, they have been found to exceed 8 m/s. Slopes occur on many scales, and consequently katabatic flows also occur on many scales. At local scales katabatic winds are a component of mountain-valley wind systems. At scales ranging from the slopes of individual hills and mountains to the slopes of mountain ranges and massifs, katabatic flows represent the nocturnal component of mountain-plains wind systems. Besides diurnal-cycle effects, surface cooling can also result from cold surfaces such as ice and snow cover. Katabatic flows over such surfaces have been studied as glacier winds in valleys and as large-scale slope flows in Antarctica and Greenland. The large- scale katabatic wind blowing down the ice dome of the Antarctic continent has sometimes reached 50 m/s on the periphery of the continent. The persistence of the surface forcing and the great extent of the slopes on these great landmasses means that the flows are subject to Coriolis deflection, and thus they are not pure katabatic flows. 2. Occasionally used in a more general sense to describe cold air flowing down a slope or incline on any of a variety of scales, including phenomena such as the bora, in addition to thermally forced flows as described above. From its etymology, the term means simply \"going down\" or \"descending,\" and thus could refer to any descending flow; some authors have further generalized it to include downslope flows such as the foehn or chinook even though they do not represent a flow of cold air. This concept has given rise to the expression katafront, which indicates flow down a sloped cold-frontal surface. #{g: xqAMSglossary | h1620}\n\nAny wind blowing down the slope of a mountain. #{g: xqPhysicalGeography | h1636}\n\n#{g: xqGCW | h1619}",

Although the pressure-gradient forcing is at its maximum at the slope, surface friction causes the peak in the katabatic wind speeds to occur above the surface, usually by a few meters to a few tens of meters. The depth of the downslope flow layer on simple slopes has been found to be 0.05 times the vertical drop from the top of the slope. Surface-wind speeds in mountain-valley katabatic flows are often 3-4 m/s, but on long slopes, they have been found to exceed 8 m/s. Slopes occur on many scales, and consequently katabatic flows also occur on many scales. At local scales katabatic winds are a component of mountain-valley wind systems. At scales ranging from the slopes of individual hills and mountains to the slopes of mountain ranges and massifs, katabatic flows represent the nocturnal component of mountain-plains wind systems. Besides diurnal-cycle effects, surface cooling can also result from cold surfaces such as ice and snow cover. Katabatic flows over such surfaces have been studied as glacier winds in valleys and as large-scale slope flows in Antarctica and Greenland. The large- scale katabatic wind blowing down the ice dome of the Antarctic continent has sometimes reached 50 m/s on the periphery of the continent. The persistence of the surface forcing and the great extent of the slopes on these great landmasses means that the flows are subject to Coriolis deflection, and thus they are not pure katabatic flows. 2. Occasionally used in a more general sense to describe cold air flowing down a slope or incline on any of a variety of scales, including phenomena such as the bora, in addition to thermally forced flows as described above. From its etymology, the term means simply \"going down\" or \"descending,\" and thus could refer to any descending flow; some authors have further generalized it to include downslope flows such as the foehn or chinook even though they do not represent a flow of cold air. This concept has given rise to the expression katafront, which indicates flow down a sloped cold-frontal surface. #{g: xqAMSglossary | h1620}",

A change in the amount of stored energy, due for example to the advection or conduction of heat or the absorption or emission of radiation, will result in a change in the temperature or the phase, or both, of the material in the volume. Phase changes, in particular melting and freezing but also sublimation and deposition, couple the energy balance strongly to the mass balance. For example they determine the amount of ablation by melting and sublimation, and so the energy balance must be determined using either an energy-balance model or a temperature-index model in any attempt to model ablation. The surface energy balance is that of an interface or degenerate volume, the thickness of which approaches zero, at the surface of the glacier. Glaciers also have internal and basal energy balances. In cold glaciers and some polythermal glaciers, the largest component of the internal energy balance is usually the heat source due to refreezing. In both the internal and basal energy balances, friction is a mechanical source of heat and heat is conducted (or advected) between adjacent volumes that are not isothermal. The geothermal heat flux is usually a significant term in the basal energy balance and basal mass balance of grounded ice, but the resulting contribution to the climatic-basal mass balance is generally small.

        "definition": "The sporadic radiant emission from the upper atmosphere over the middle and high latitudes. It is believed to be due primarily to the emission of the nitrogen molecule N2, its molecular ion N2+, and atomic oxygen [O]. According to various theories, auroras seem definitely to be related to magnetic storms and the influx of charged particles from the sun. The exact details of the nature of the mechanisms involved are still being investigated. The aurora is most intense at times of magnetic storms (when it is also observed farthest equatorward) and shows a periodicity related to the sun's 27-day rotation period and the 11-year sunspot cycle. The distribution with height shows a pronounced maximum near 100 km. The lower limit is probably near 80 km. The aurora can often be clearly seen, and it assumes a variety of shapes and colors that are characteristic patterns of auroral emission. The names given to the various forms are 1) arcs, which are bands of light extending across the sky, the highest point of the arc being in the direction of the magnetic meridian; 2) rays, which may appear as single lines like a searchlight beam, or in bundles; 3) draperies, which have a curtainlike appearance, sharp on the bottom and tenuous in the upper parts; 4) crown or corona, which are seen when the rays appear to spread out from a single point in the sky; 5) bands, which are similar to the arcs, and may or may not have a ray structure; and 6) diffuse luminous surfaces, which appear as luminous clouds of indefinite shape. Sometimes the term \"streamers\" is used to describe the auroral forms that extend to great heights. In northern latitudes these displays are called aurora borealis, aurora polaris, or northern lights; in southern latitudes they are called aurora australis. #{g: xqAMSglossary | h1620}",

The process is referred to as heterogeneous nucleation, as opposed to homogeneous nucleation, which depends on the formation of an ice particle large enough to grow by random motion of water molecules alone. Four processes are generally distinguished: 1) deposition (sorption; previously called sublimation), where the ice phase forms directly from water vapor; 2) condensation freezing, where the ice phase forms in a supercooled solution following growth and dilution of a cloud condensation nucleus; 3) contact freezing, where a supercooled droplet nucleates following contact of an ice nucleating aerosol; 4) immersion freezing, where the nucleating particle is completely immersed in the supercooled liquid, which nucleates with sufficient cooling. Because of this multiplicity of nucleation mechanisms it is often difficult to deduce the processes active in a given cloud. Artificially generated aerosols such as silver iodide show activity by all four mechanisms, but at different rates. For natural ice nucleating aerosols, activities in all modes do not generally occur. Observations strongly suggest that, whatever their physico-chemical nature, most natural nuclei act through a freezing process rather than by deposition. #{g: xqAMSglossary | h1620}",

        "definition": "The dimension of mass balance is [M] (mass). The dimension of the mass-balance rate is [M T-1] (mass per unit time). When the mass balance is presented per unit area, it is called specific mass balance and its dimension becomes [M L-2], while the dimension of the mass-balance rate becomes [M L-2 T-1]. When water-equivalent units are adopted (see below), the dimension becomes [L3] or [L3T-1], the corresponding specific units being [L] or [L T-1]. The unit for expressing mass or change of mass numerically is the kilogram (kg). When more convenient the petagram (Pg) or gigatonne (Gt; 1 Gt = 1 Pg = 1012 kg) can be substituted. When mass balance is expressed per unit area, its unit is kg m-2. The unit kg m-2 is usually replaced by the millimetre water equivalent, mm w. E. This substitution is convenient because 1 kg of liquid water, of density 1000 kg m-3, has a vertical extent of exactly 1 mm when distributed uniformly over a horizontal area of 1 m2. The units kg m-2 and mm w. E. Are therefore numerically identical. More formally, the metre water equivalent (m w. E.) Is an extension of the SI that is obtained by dividing a particular mass per unit area by the density of water, w: 1 m w. E. = 1000 kg m-2 / w: Because of the risk of confusion with the metre ice equivalent, or with ordinary lengths, it is important that the qualifier 'w. E.' Not be omitted. Mass balances can also be stated in m3 w. E. (1 m3 w. E. = 1 m w. E. Distributed uniformly over 1 m2) or km3 w. E. Note that 1 km3 w. E. Is numerically identical with 1 Gt. For the mass-balance rate, appropriate units are kg a-1 or kg m-2 a-1 (or m3 w. E. A-1 or mm w. E. A-1) when the time span is an integer multiple of 1 year. Over shorter intervals the unit of time should be the second or the day. Mass units (kg or m3 w. E.) Are useful for hydrological and oceanographic purposes, while specific mass units (kg m-2, mm w. E., m w. E.) Are needed when comparing the mass balances of different glaciers and for studying glacier-climate relations. To convert, with sufficient accuracy for many purposes, to the frequently needed sea-level equivalent (SLE), mass balance in kg m-2 is first converted to kg by multiplying by the area of the glacier, and then divided by the product of w and the area of the ocean (362.5 1012 m2). The sign of SLE is opposite to that of glacier mass balance, a loss from the ice being deemed to be an equivalent gain for the ocean. #{g: xqIHPGlacierMassBalance | h1629}",

A synthetic aperture radar (SAR) consists of a side-looking radar system that takes advantage of the forward motion of the radar platform to synthesize a very long antenna, enabling a much higher ground resolution than in ordinary radar altimetry. Each SAR acquisition contains information on the amplitude and phase of the radiation reflected from the target and received at the antenna. Interferometric SAR requires the calculation of differences in phase between two co-registered SAR images obtained with slightly different viewing geometries, either at the same time from two antennae, or at two different times from one antenna. These phase differences yield fringe patterns (interferograms) that are an expression of both surface topography and surface motion. If the surface is not in motion, or the time between images is sufficiently short, phase differences can be converted to surface elevations with knowledge of the attitude and orbital position of the interferometer; more specifically, the baseline length, or distance between the two orbital positions, must be known. Using insar to detect motion of the surface requires imagery from two different epochs (repeat pass interferometry).In this case topographic effects are removed using an independently derived digital elevation model. #{g: xqIHPGlacierMassBalance | h1629}",

Thickness can change at a point due to ablation and accumulation at the surface and bottom of the glacier, compaction of snow and firn, or a non-zero emergence velocity or submergence velocity. Thickness change is often used interchangeably with elevation change, but the two are not necessarily the same. For example, elevation can change due to glacial isostatic adjustment or vertical tectonic motions, without a change in glacier thickness. The thickness change at a point is not equivalent to the climatic-basal mass balance at that point because the thickness change may be due in part to emergence or submergence. Thickness change at a point is therefore not a direct indicator of the local climate. The glacier-wide mean thickness change is the volume change of the entire glacier divided by the mean glacier area during the time span of the measurements: 2(h V VS S 21)/(21) , where V is volume, S is area, and subscripts 1 and 2 refer to measurements at an earlier and later time, respectively. The quantity 21( ) V V V is the volume change. Usually the two volumes are not known separately, and: V is obtained from measurements of by geodetic methods. The mean thickness change, if multiplied by the density of the mass gained or lost, is equal to the glacier-wide mass balance over the period of the thickness change. The mean thickness change differs from the change of mean thickness, which is V2/S2 V1/S1. #{g: xqIHPGlacierMassBalance | h1629}",

The five quantities measured (Figure 13) over the course of the mass-balance year are at t0, when by definition there is no snow, the distance d0 from the stake top to the summer surface; at tw, the distance dw from the stake top to the surface and (in a nearby snow pit or with a coring device) the mean density w of the snow (if any; the winter balance is not necessarily positive); and at t1, the distance d1 from the stake top to the surface and the mean density 1 of the snow (if any). The layer thicknesses hw and h1are obtained by subtraction, as beneath the figure; note that in the right part of the figure the Annual balance is negative because the thickness h1 is negative. When the balance is positive the stake measurements are often supplemented by digging or probing to sample local variability. It is not possible to measure the density of mass that is lost between any two survey dates. For example the summer balance is commonly evaluated as ba bw; and when h1 is negative an appropriate value (usually, outside the firn area, the density of ice) must be assumed for 1. At the instant following t1, any residual snow is deemed to become firn and the glacier surface, at d1, becomes the summer surface d0 of the next balance year. #{g: xqIHPGlacierMassBalance | h1629}",

Aircraft systems measure the altimeter trajectory using GPS and inertial navigation systems. Accurate altimetry measurements, especially those acquired from space, require corrections for variations in atmospheric and ionospheric conditions, and for variations in orbital position of the sensor. Altimeters are either laser altimeters or radar altimeters. Each of the two radiation bands has strengths and weaknesses with respect to footprint size and ability to sample through atmospheric obstructions such as clouds. Altimetry measurements are compared with surface elevations obtained at identical points in horizontal space at an earlier time to calculate elevation changes which can then be used to compute volume changes. The earlier elevation measurement is commonly obtained from a previous altimetry pass, but can also be derived from other sources such as topographic maps.

In the ablation zone, the earlier summer surface has disappeared by the time the later one is observed, but its vertical position is known from earlier observations. For seasonal balances, it is not possible to determine the Annual maximum of mass with a single field survey that can be scheduled to coincide only roughly with the expected date of the maximum. Thus, in the stratigraphic system, seasonal balances by the glaciological method are actually measured in a combined system. Continuously recording sensors, such as snow pillows and sonic rangers, can yield accurate stratigraphic-system estimates of seasonal balances at single points, but they are not in wide use. The Annual extrema of mass may be reached at different times at different sites on the glacier. Glacier-wide balances in the stratigraphic system can be determined rigorously only by accurate spatially-distributed modeling or by gravimetric methods. Determinations based on field measurements must assume that the diachronous character of the summer surface can be neglected.

        "definition": "The time system in which the determination of mass balance is based on the identification of successive Annual minima, and for seasonal balances Annual maxima also, in the mass of the glacier or a part of the glacier. In field work, Annual mass balance is determined by the detection of two successive summer surfaces, usually at individual observation sites. In the ablation zone, the earlier summer surface has disappeared by the time the later one is observed, but its vertical position is known from earlier observations. For seasonal balances, it is not possible to determine the Annual maximum of mass with a single field survey that can be scheduled to coincide only roughly with the expected date of the maximum. Thus, in the stratigraphic system, seasonal balances by the glaciological method are actually measured in a combined system. Continuously recording sensors, such as snow pillows and sonic rangers, can yield accurate stratigraphic-system estimates of seasonal balances at single points, but they are not in wide use. The Annual extrema of mass may be reached at different times at different sites on the glacier. Glacier-wide balances in the stratigraphic system can be determined rigorously only by accurate spatially-distributed modeling or by gravimetric methods. Determinations based on field measurements must assume that the diachronous character of the summer surface can be neglected. The duration of the mass-balance year varies in the stratigraphic system. #{g: xqIHPGlacierMassBalance | h1629}",

Also called Mass Budget. #{g: xqUSGSGlaciers(ambiguous) | -}The change in the mass of a glacier, or part of the glacier, over a stated span of time; the term mass budget is a synonym. See mass-balance units for recommended units. The span of time is often a year or a season. A seasonal mass balance is nearly always either a winter balance or a summer balance, although other kinds of season are appropriate in some climates, such as those of the tropics. The definition of year depends on the method adopted for measurement of the balance. See time system. The reference in the definition to a glacier means that a particular volume of space is being studied. A properly delineated glacier has no mass transfer of ice across its boundary other than as ice discharge. However, the mass balance is often quoted for volumes other than that of the whole glacier, for example a column through the glacier, the part of the glacier upglacier or downglacier from the grounding line, or a band defined by two contours of surface elevation. It is necessary in such cases to make clear that the study volume is something other than the whole glacier, and also to make clear which components of the mass balance are being reported. The quantity reported may be the climatic mass balance or the climatic-basal mass balance, but will often be the surface mass balance. In all cases the need for a defined study volume is fundamental because without it the principle of conservation of mass cannot be invoked. The study volume may change over the study period. The surface and bed elevations may change, and the areal extent is unlikely to be the same at the end of the period as it was at the beginning. Whether these changes are significant will depend not just on their magnitude and the accuracy with which they can be determined but on the purpose of the investigation.

Ocean currents and the atmospheric circulation result in a net divergence of sea ice around the continent, causing most of the ice to melt in the summer as it drifts into warmer waters, or as the upper ocean heats up as the open water areas within the pack absorb solar radiation. The Weddell Sea accounts for about 80% of the multi-year ice in the Antarctic. The clockwise circulating current known as the Weddell Gyre is responsible for trapping sea ice along the eastern side of the Antarctic Peninsula, allowing it to survive for more than one year. Eventually the current transports the ice further north where it dissipates into the ocean and melts. Melt patterns on multi-year ice are a feature most commonly observed in the Arctic.

In the 'warm infiltration-recrystallization zone', generally at lower elevation and sometimes called the 'warm firn zone', the temperature is at or near the freezing point and refreezing makes a lesser contribution to the formation of ice. The runoff limit may lie within the warm firn zone, or within the cold firn zone where slopes are steep. #{g: xqIHPGlacierMassBalance | h1629}",

The general water balance equation is W = P E Q , where P is precipitation, E is evapotranspiration, Q is runoff and W is the change in storage. The water balance is the basis of the hydrological method of determination of glacier mass balance. Typically in glaciological research the defined volume is a drainage basin tributary to a discharge measurement station near to the glacier margin, and not all of the basin is glacierized. Transfers of water by precipitation and evapotranspiration will include transfers not passing through the boundary of the glacier, and stores of water will include lakes, seasonal snowpatches, soil and aquifers as well as the glacier. Changes in each of the non-glacial stores must be accounted for to isolate the glacier mass balance. It can be convenient in glacier hydrology to distinguish between meltwater runoff from glacier iceand firn and runoff from the basin-wide snowpack, the latter including the snow on the glacier. Denoting these stores by I and N respectively, and assuming that changes in other stores are negligible, I = N Ei qin = Pn En Qn. #{g: xqIHPGlacierMassBalance | h1629}",

        "definition": "A fall wind with a source so cold that, when the air reaches the lowlands or coast, the dynamic warming is insufficient to raise the air temperature to the normal level for the region; hence it appears as a cold wind. The terms borino and boraccia denote a weak bora and a strong bora, respectively. The term was originally applied (along with karstbora) to the cold northeast wind on the Dalmatian coast of Croatia and Bosnia in winter when cold air from Russia crosses the mountains and descends to the relatively warm coast of the Adriatic. According to Smith (1987), the bora \"has often been considered the prototype fall wind,\" although recent studies have revealed that some boras have downslope windstorm or hydraulic jump structure. The event often lasts a day or less, although extended events occur with enough frequency that \"the longevity of the bora is one of its primary characteristics. A duration of four to six days is not unusual.\" It is very stormy and squally, the squalls sometimes reaching 50 m s-1 or more. F. Defant (1951) distinguishes between cyclonic bora (bora scura) with clouds and rain, covering the whole Adriatic and occurring with a depression over southern Adria, and the dry anticyclonic bora, with a powerful anticyclone over central Europe extending over Dalmatia; the latter is very violent over the land but extends only a short distance out to sea. A local bora also occurs on the east coast of the Adriatic with a cold anticyclone over the Balkans. The term bora is now applied to similar winds in other parts of the world. Well-known examples occur at Novorossiisk on the northern shore of the Black Sea, and in Novaya Zemlya (islands in the Russian Arctic). A squally katabatic wind at Alme Dagh in the Gulf of Iskenderon (eastern Mediterranean Sea) is termed rageas (also ragut, ghaziyah). The Bulgarian term is buria. In some mountainous regions of the world bora has been further generalized to represent any large mesoscale or synoptic-scale downslope flow of cold air, including post- arctic-frontal fall winds and cold-air downslope windstorms, which may have a hydraulic jump- like character and structure. In the case of downslope windstorms, some authors have used bora for a cold-advection flow (or one that results in cooling to the immediate lee of the mountain barrier), whereas chinook or foehn refer to a warm- or neutral-advection wind (or one that results in warming or no temperature change leeward of the barrier). Those who have attempted to classify downslope windstorms, however, have found that many cases do not fall neatly into one category or the other. #{g: xqAMSglossary | h1620}",

        "definition": "Clouds are cirrus or altocumulus lenticularis, and show very strong irisation similar to that of mother-of-pearl, especially when the sun is several degrees below the horizon. They occur at heights about 20-30 km above the earth. These clouds are rarely seen, and it would appear that they can be observed only in certain regions. They have been observed mainly over Antarctica due to the lower temperatures present there in the circumpolar vortex. They also form over Scotland and Scandinavia in winter during periods with an intense, broad, deep, and homogeneous westerly to northwesterly flow of air over northern Europe; they are also observed in Alaska. Less frequent sightings have been reported at lower latitudes. The simultaneous occurrence of various colors of the spectrum in more or less irregular patterns strongly suggests diffraction by spherical particles. The exact physical constitution of cloud particles has been determined by aircraft (e.g., the NASA ER2 aircraft) penetration showing the presence of nitric acid hydrates (in particular nitric acid tri-hydrate, type I) with the addition of water ice at temperatures a few degrees lower (type II). Nuclei for clouds are thought to be sulfuric acid aerosol, possibly of volcanic origin. The clouds form in regions where dynamic lifting or radiational cooling lowers the air to temperatures below saturation for these different constituents (about 95C). PSC are thought to play a major role in the formation of the \"ozone hole\" because they absorb odd nitrogen from the atmosphere, which allows the catalytic destruction of ozone to occur. Nacreous clouds appear stationary and, by day, often resemble pale cirrus. At sunset, all the colors of the spectrum appear; as the sky darkens after sunset, they increase in brilliance. As the sun drops lower and lower below the horizon and the clouds are lighted by last rays, the various colors are replaced by a general coloration that is first orange and then becomes pink, contrasting vividly with the darkening sky. The clouds next become gray and the colors of the spectrum reappear but very weakly, then fade out rapidly. Later, up until about two hours after sunset, the nacreous clouds can still be distinguished standing out against the starry sky as tenuous and gray clouds. They can even be observed all night if there is moonlight. Before dawn, the same series of aspects appear, but in reverse order.

The frostless zone is not a fixed belt but varies in level from night to night and season to season according to the initial temperature, the length of the night, and the clearness of the sky. Its lower limit is sometimes clearly marked by the upper limit of frost damage to crops, following the hillsides at a small angle to the horizontal.

These minima are usually reached at different times in successive years, and the duration of the mass-balance year may therefore vary irregularly and substantially in duration from year to year. Point mass balances can be determined unambiguously in the stratigraphic system, but glacier-wide determinations require the assumption that the diachronous character of the summer surface can be neglected. In the fixed-date system the first day of the mass-balance year is always on the same calendar date, which is typically chosen to coincide with the start of the local hydrological year, for example 1 October in the mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere or 1 April in the mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, or sometimes with the average date of minimum Annual mass. The mass-balance year is 365 (or 366) days long.

The term is often used for 'pressure melting and regelation'. Regelation happens because the pressure-melting point of ice varies inversely with pressure. Water in equilibrium with ice will freeze, releasing the latent heat of fusion, 333.5 k: J kg-1, if there is a decrease of pressure, as on the downglacier face of a bump in the bed of a temperate glacier. Ice in equilibrium with water will melt if there is an increase of pressure, as on the upglacier face of the bump. However, the latent heat of fusion must be supplied for this change of phase. A natural source is the latent heat released by regelation on the downglacier face. If pressure melting and regelation are unequal, there will be a contribution to basal ablation or basal accumulation. Smaller bumps are more favourable to pressure melting and regelation than larger ones. The Russian word 'regelatsiya' refers to refreezing rather than to regelation. #{g: xqIHPGlacierMassBalance | h1629}\n\nRegelation is the phenomenon of melting under pressure and freezing again when the pressure is reduced. A Glacier can exert a sufficient amount of pressure on its lower surface to lower the melting point of its ice. The melting of the Ice at the glacier's base allows it to move from a higher elevation to a lower elevation. Liquid water may flow from the base of a Glacier at lower elevations when the temperature of the air is above the freezing point of water. #{g: xqTrombottoGeocryology | h1639}\n\nA twofold process in which a localized region on the surface of a piece of ice melts when pressure is applied to that region (pressure melting) and then refreezes when pressure is reduced. Regelation was discovered by Faraday, who found that two pieces of ice at 0C would freeze together if pressed against each other and then released. Regelation occurs only for substances, such as ice, that have the property of expanding upon freezing, for the melting points of those substances decrease with increasing external pressure. The melting point of pure ice decreases with pressure at the rate of 0.0072C per atmosphere. Since this rate is very small, regelation only occurs at ice temperatures of 0C or very slightly less. The fact that snowballs can be packed well at near 0C but not at much colder temperatures is a consequence of regelation. #{g: xqAMSglossary | h1620}\n\n#{g: xqGCW | h1619}",

        "definition": "The freezing of meltwater due to a change in pressure alone. The term is often used for 'pressure melting and regelation'. Regelation happens because the pressure-melting point of ice varies inversely with pressure. Water in equilibrium with ice will freeze, releasing the latent heat of fusion, 333.5 k: J kg-1, if there is a decrease of pressure, as on the downglacier face of a bump in the bed of a temperate glacier. Ice in equilibrium with water will melt if there is an increase of pressure, as on the upglacier face of the bump. However, the latent heat of fusion must be supplied for this change of phase. A natural source is the latent heat released by regelation on the downglacier face. If pressure melting and regelation are unequal, there will be a contribution to basal ablation or basal accumulation. Smaller bumps are more favourable to pressure melting and regelation than larger ones. The Russian word 'regelatsiya' refers to refreezing rather than to regelation. #{g: xqIHPGlacierMassBalance | h1629}",

Regelation was discovered by Faraday, who found that two pieces of ice at 0C would freeze together if pressed against each other and then released. Regelation occurs only for substances, such as ice, that have the property of expanding upon freezing, for the melting points of those substances decrease with increasing external pressure. The melting point of pure ice decreases with pressure at the rate of 0.0072C per atmosphere. Since this rate is very small, regelation only occurs at ice temperatures of 0C or very slightly less. The fact that snowballs can be packed well at near 0C but not at much colder temperatures is a consequence of regelation. #{g: xqAMSglossary | h1620}",

Fresh snow has a high albedo (0.7 to 0.9), indicating that 70 to 90 percent of the radiation received is reflected; glacier ice has a lower albedo of 0.2 to 0.4.

On most glaciers there are no thickness measurements at all and the thickness must be estimated, for example by volume-area scaling or as a function of surface slope and estimated basal shear stress. The definition of thickness as a vertical distance is adopted almost invariably in studies of mass balance, but not in all branches of cryospheric science. For example Fierz et al.

'Till' refers to the debris deposited directly by the glacier. Rock debris rolls off the glacier edges and builds piles of loose unconsolidated rocks called 'glacier moraine'. 'Lateral moraines' form along the side of a glacier and curl into a 'terminal moraine' at the glacier's downvalley end.

There they have been defined as \"a flow of air in a sea level channel that accelerates under the influence of a pressure gradient parallel to the axis of the channel.\" As in the case of mountain- gap winds, this term has also been applied to pressure-gradient winds accelerating through a gap in a mountain barrier. The pressure gradient often results from a stable, post-cold-frontal anticyclone approaching the barrier and being partially blocked (see blocking) as it ascends the barrier, except for the flow through the gap or channel. The tehuantepecer of Central America is a well- known gap wind by this definition. These flows have sometimes been referred to as jet-effect wind and canyon wind. #{g: xqAMSglossary | h1620}",

(Some of the other forms have very unusual properties, ice VII, for example, being stable only at pressures above 22 400 kg/cm^2, but then existing at temperatures up to about 100C.) Ice has an open structure because the water molecules bond to their neighbors covalently only in four directions; it therefore floats on higher density water, where broken molecular bonds permit closer packing. All commonly occurring forms of ice are crystalline, although large single crystals are relatively rare except in glaciers. The ice crystal lattice possesses hexagonal symmetry that manifests itself in the gross forms of such single crystals as are sometimes found in snow. At an air pressure of one atmosphere, ice melts at 0C by definition of the Celsius temperature scale. (Strictly at equilibrium among water, ice, and vapor occurs at +0.01C, the triple point.) On the other hand, ice does not invariably form in liquid water cooled below this temperature; it has a tendency to supercool, more so in the absence of ice nuclei. #{g: xqAMSglossary | h1620}",

A profiling system is nadir-pointing, while a scanning system uses a rotating mirror, or a series of sensors arrayed in a parallel (push broom) configuration, to obtain a swath rather than a linear profile of measurements. The Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (icesat, 20032010) measured surface elevations with approximately 70 m footprint and 170 m along-track spacing. Adjacent tracks are separated by a few to a few tens of kilometres, the lesser separations being found at the polar extremities of the orbit. Sources of error include sensor saturation, atmospheric scattering effects, and inaccurate knowledge of the laser pointing angles. Aircraft altimeters have footprints of 1 m or smaller and along-track spacing on the order of 1 to 3 m, and are less affected by atmospheric and pointing errors. Laser altimeters are unable to obtain measurements through clouds. Laser is an acronym standing for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation.

A surge-type glacier exhibits quiescent phases, typically lasting some decades, during which velocities are lower than in a 'normal', non-surge-type glacier. The ice discharge is thus too small to maintain the longitudinal profile of the glacier, which thickens in its upper reaches and thins in its lower reaches. Surges recur at quasi-periodic, glacier-specific intervals, and transfer large quantities of ice from the thickened upper part to the thinned lower part. Velocities during the surge are often greater by an order of magnitude than those during the quiescent phase. A surge-type glacier will almost always be out of balance. That is, a surge-type glacier cannot be in steady state. Surge-type glaciers may end on land or in water, and the proportion of glaciers that are of surge type varies from region to region. The mechanism of surging is poorly understood. Surges seem, however, to be related to changes in the subglacial hydrological regime and not primarily to climatic fluctuations. Although surging is best documented on smaller glaciers, many larger outlet glaciers of ice caps have been observed to surge, and there may be a connection with the unsteady behaviour exhibited by some ice streams. #{g: xqIHPGlacierMassBalance | h1629}",

The ending of each of these groups of events is marked by a major flux of icebergs into the North Atlantic, as evidenced by associated material found in ocean floor sediments. The temperature conditions in Greenland and the North Atlantic region then return to the higher level of the beginning of the group of Dansgaard-Oeschger events.

Valley cooling is accomplished by the combined effects of draining cold air off the slopes by early-evening downslope (katabatic) winds, and upward motion with upward cold-air advection from the convergence of katabatic flows in the valley center. Air in the valley thus becomes cooler than air at the same level over the adjacent plain ( see topographic amplification factor), producing higher pressure in the valley. The pressure gradient drives a downvalley wind that begins one to four hours after sunset, persists for the rest of the night until after sunrise, and often reaches 7-10 m s-1 or more above the surface. The downvalley wind tends to fill the valley, that is, its depth is approximately the depth of the valley, and where mountains end and a valley empties onto the plains, the downvalley wind can become a cold-air valley outflow jet flowing out of the mouth of the valley.

Snowfall is most common with the frontal lifting associated with mid-latitude cyclones during fall, winter, and spring months when air temperatures are below freezing. #{g: xqPhysicalGeography | h1636}",

The essence of the method is that measured changes in the exposed length of the cable (or equivalent measurements of the local surface mass balance), and in the surface elevation (measured by the GNSS receiver), yield two of the three terms in the continuity equation and allow the third term, the submergence or emergence velocity (that is, the flux divergence) to be determined. Corrections may be needed for the densification (that is, settling) of firn beneath the anchor and for downslope advection of the anchor. The coffee-can method has been used mainly in the accumulation zones of ice sheets, where the surface mass balance can be obtained by ice-core stratigraphy. However in the ablation zone the emergence of cables emplaced for other reasons, such as the measurement of temperature profiles, can serve a similar purpose. #{g: xqIHPGlacierMassBalance | h1629}",

The units in which a quantity is reported make clear whether or not it is specific. Specific mass balance may be reported for a point on the surface, a column of unit cross-section, or a larger volume such as an entire glacier or a collection of glaciers. In the latter two cases the term 'mean specific mass balance' has been used, although the adjective 'mean' is also not necessary. The definition of 'specific' apparently offered by Meier (1962) has led to some confusion. He wrote... Quantities measured at a point will first be discussed. [They] should all be prefaced by the word specific ...Specific budget terms have dimensions of [length] or [length]/[time]. The confusion arises because of the primacy given by Meier to water-equivalent dimensions ('[length]'). The adjective 'specific' indicates that the quantity has dimension [M L-2] or [M L-2 T-1], not that it is being measured at a point. The adjective 'point', as in point mass balance, should be used when clarity is needed. The unit of area lies in the horizontal plane, not a plane parallel to the glacier surface. For mass-balance purposes this rule applies even when the surface is vertical. For example, at a calving front the frontal ablation is equal to the mass of the entire volume lost by calving, melting and sublimation. If quoted as a specific quantity it is divided by the horizontal area over which the balance is to be stated, such as that of the entire glacier for a glacier-wide mass balance. The glaciological usage is not that which prevails in some other sciences, where often a specific quantity is either a dimensionless ratio of the value of a property of a given substance to the value of the same property of some reference substance, or is a quantity expressed per unit mass. #{g: xqIHPGlacierMassBalance | h1629}",

        "definition": "The removal of ice by melting at the base of a glacier. At the base of grounded temperate ice, melting is either fuelled by the geothermal heat flux and the conversion of the kinetic energy of basal sliding to heat, or results from variations of the pressure-melting point. Pressure melting, however, tends to be balanced by regelation. Typical continental geothermal heat fluxes G of 0.050.15 W m-2 imply potential basal ablation G/Lf of 514 mm w. E. A-1, where Lf is the latent heat of fusion. Much greater geothermal heat fluxes are found in areas of Active volcanism. If all of the energy of basal sliding is converted to heat, basal ablation ubb/Lf at rates of 330 mm w. E. A-1 is implied by sliding velocities ub of 10100 m a-1 and basal shear stress b of 105 Pa. Basal ablation rates tens or hundreds of times greater are implied beneath ice streams. At the base of an ice shelf or floating tongue, melting occurs because of convection of warmer sea water to the ice-water interface, supplying the required latent heat of fusion. The rate of melting depends on the temperature of the sea water and the efficiency of the heat transfer between the seawater and the base of the ice shelf. Basal ablation rates beneath ice shelves or floating tongues can reach tens of m w. E. A-1, equivalent to heat transfer at hundreds of W m-2. #{g: xqIHPGlacierMassBalance | h1629}",

The alpenglow boundary may first occur hundreds of meters below the summit, then moves upward, and finally fades as the atmosphere's dark segment rises. Third is the afterglow, which occurs nearly simultaneously with the first purple light. The peaks are no longer in direct sunlight; the illumination is more diffuse and its boundary vaguer than in the earlier stages. The third stage lasts longer than the other two (-5 < h0 < -9), and its color varies from yellow to purple. A faint second afterglow has been reported and is associated with the rare occurrence of a second purple light. The alpenglow appears to be much less common at sunrise than at sunset.

Current speed in the ACC is comparatively modest (0.1 m/s, but larger in fronts), the large transport being achieved by the current's great depth. Seventy-five percent of the transport occurs in the polar and subantarctic fronts that make up only 20% of the ACC area. Interannual variability is about 15% of the mean but can reach 40% on occasions. The ACC is influenced by bottom topography, which causes deflections from its general westward path and eddy formation, particularly at the Scotia Ridge, the Kerguelen Plateau, and the Macquarie Ridge. The eddies are instrumental for the poleward transport of heat across the current, which would otherwise block meridional heat transfer. #{g: xqAMSglossary | h1620}",

The density of dry snow increases rapidly at first, by the conversion of snowflakes to grains. Then, usually under the pressure of an increasing overburden of newer snow, density increases more slowly by settling of the grains to about 550 kg m-3, representing the maximum practically attainable packing. Snow becomes firn (in the structural sense) over a range of density beginning at about 400 kg m-3.Beyond the maximum packing density, even slower mechanisms of densification sintering and plastic deformation of the grains, and recrystallization become dominant. When the firn reaches a density of about 830 kg m-3, the pore spaces between crystals are closed off, air can no longer flow (as opposed to diffusing through the crystal lattices), and the substance is deemed to be glacier ice. When there has been no melting, densification rarely proceeds beyond 400 kg m-3 over the course of a typical mid-latitude winter. Depending on the accumulation (that is, loading) rate, glacier ice may be produced in times from a few years to a few centuries. Melting followed by refreezing can yield bulk densities near that of pure ice in times shorter than a day. #{g: xqIHPGlacierMassBalance | h1629}",

Glacier volume V is the product of area S and mean thickness H. Measured mean thicknesses are well described by a relation of the form H c S1, which is the basis for the volume-area relation V c S . Here c and are parameters estimated from samples of glaciers with measured thicknesses. There is good evidence, as shown by Bahr et al. (1997), that estimates of from observations are nearly consistent with theoretical expectation. Mean thickness is also sometimes estimated as a function of average surface slope and basal shear stress. Volumearea scaling is both a way of estimating regional and global glacier volumes from abundant data on glacier area, and a possible way of estimating (with large random uncertainty) the volume balance of single glaciers from successive measurements of area S1 and S2, for example as2 1 ()2(2V c S S . It can also be used, as a practical alternative to ice-flow modelling, to estimate glacier area changes in attempts to model the response of glaciers to climatic change. Glacier volume is also expected, and found, to scale with glacier length, particularly when the length is that of a flowline. #{g: xqIHPGlacierMassBalance | h1629}",

'Till' refers to the debris deposited directly by the glacier. Rock debris rolls off the glacier edges and builds piles of loose unconsolidated rocks called 'glacier moraine'. 'Lateral moraines' form along the side of a glacier and curl into a 'terminal moraine' at the glacier's downvalley end.

Evidence is accumulating for a wider, perhaps global, extent, but the Younger Dryas was most strongly felt around the North Atlantic Ocean. Changes in the thermohaline circulation of the oceans are widely believed to be implicated in the onset and ending of the Younger Dryas cooling. These were in turn associated with a switch to the St. Lawrence River as the major route for meltwater reaching the North Atlantic from the retreating continental ice cap. Other similarly rapid oscillations in climate are recorded through much of the last glacial in ice cores from Greenland and in marine sediment cores from the North Atlantic (Dansgaard-Oeschger events).

        "definition": "Any one of a number of macroscopic, crystalline forms in which ice appears, including hexagonal columns, hexagonal platelets, dendritic crystals, ice needles, and combinations of these forms. The crystal lattice of ice is hexagonal in its symmetry under most atmospheric conditions. Varying conditions of temperature and vapor pressure can lead to growth of crystalline forms in which the simple hexagonal pattern is present in widely different habits (a thin hexagonal plate or a long thin hexagonal column). In many ice crystals, trigonal symmetry can be observed, suggesting an influence of a cubic symmetry. The principal axis (c axis) of a single crystal of ice is perpendicular to the axis of hexagonal symmetry. Planes perpendicular to this axis are called basal planes (a axes related to the prism facets) and present a hexagonal cross section. Ice is anisotropic in both its optical and electrical properties and has a high dielectric constant (even higher than water) resulting from its water dipole structure. The electrical relaxation time for water is much shorter than for ice (10^9 Hz compared with 10^4 Hz), resulting from a chain reaction requirement for molecules to relax through defects in the ice lattice. In the free air, ice crystals compose cirrus-type clouds, and near the ground they form the hydrometeor called, remarkably enough, \"ice crystals\" (or ice prisms). They are one constituent of ice fog, the other constituent being droxtals. On terrestrial objects the ice crystal is the elemental unit of hoarfrost in all of its various forms. Ice crystals that form in slightly supercooled water are termed frazil. Ice originating as frozen water (e.g., hail, graupel, and lake ice) still has hexagonal symmetry but lacks any external hexagonal form. Analysis of their sections (0.5 mm) in polarized light reveals different crystal shapes and orientations, depending on the freezing and any annealing and subsequent recrystallization process. #{g: xqAMSglossary | h1620}",

        "definition": "The term polar vortex is used to describe several different features in the atmosphere. It most commonly refers to a planetary-scale mid- to high-latitude circumpolar circulation. There are distinct tropospheric and stratospheric circumpolar vortices. The tropospheric polar vortex is usually defined by geopotential contours that lie within the core of the tropospheric westerlies.1 The tropospheric vortex edge is generally between 40\u02da and 50\u02da latitude (Fig. 1), and the vortex exists throughout the year but is strongest during winter when the air within the polar vortex is the coldest. The term 'polar vortex' is sometimes used in reference to smaller-scale (meso- to synoptic scale) vortices that usually occur within the tropospheric polar vortex in polar regions near the tropopause - for example, tropopause polar vortices. 2. The stratospheric polar vortex exists from spring to fall and usually extends from just above tropopause to the upper stratosphere (see Fig. 1). The stratospheric vortex generally increases in size from the lower stratosphere to the upper stratosphere where its edge is located around 50\u02da latitude. The stratospheric vortex breaks down, and the circumpolar flow reverses, during summer. 3. Circumpolar vortices have also been observed on other planetary bodies (e.g., Mars, Venus, Saturn, and Titan). 4. #{g: xqAMSglossary | h1620}",

In common usage, 'net balance' has a number of meanings inconsistent with that of Anonymous (1969; Appendix A). It is used for the balance over approximately one year, regardless of the time system (see fixed-date system, floating-date system), and for balances over other periods than the mass-balance year. In these usages 'net' has its plain-language meaning, referring to the change of mass after all deductions (here ablation) have been made. To resolve this ambiguity, it is recommended that the original definition of 'net mass balance' be retired, and that i) Annual mass balance be used instead for the mass balance over a mass-balance year in any time system; and ii) explicit information about the time system be given as metadata whenever it is relevant (as it is for all measurements by the glaciological method). The adjective 'net' thus becomes a plain-language word, and in many cases becomes redundant because the meaning of 'balance' includes the meaning of 'net'. #{g: xqIHPGlacierMassBalance | h1629}",

Homogeneous nucleation occurs when the change of state centers upon embryos that exist in the same initial state as the changing substance. In this case, the nucleation system contains only one component, and it is termed homogeneous nucleation. In meteorology, particularly in cloud physics, a number of types of nucleation are of interest. The process by which cloud condensation nuclei initiate the phase change from vapor to liquid is important in all cloud formation problems. The physical nature of freezing nuclei that may be responsible for the conversion of drops of supercooled water into ice crystals is critically important in precipitation theory, as is the clarification of the role of homogeneous nucleation near -40C.

Frequencies from about 5 ghz up to 37 ghz are used in the study of quantities related to mass balance with passive-microwave sensors. The intensity of emission depends on the temperature of the medium and its emissivity. See brightness temperature. Microwave radiometers in orbit have resolutions of a few to a few tens of kilometres, so that they are best suited to monitoring of extensive ice and snow covers. All are in polar, sun-synchronous orbits, and offer daily near-global coverage. At high latitudes, coverage is available at least twice daily, that is, from an ascending (south to north) pass, typically in the afternoon or evening, and a descending (north to south) pass, typically in the morning. SMMR, the Scanning Multi-channel Microwave Radiometer, operated from 1978 to 1987. SSM/I, the Special Sensor Microwave Imager, was first launched in 1987 and has operated on several different satellites since. AMSR-E, the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System, has operated since 2002. In snow hydrology, passive-microwave radiometers are operational tools for the estimation of snow water equivalent ('SWE'). #{g: xqIHPGlacierMassBalance | h1629}",

Response times have been formulated for various attributes of the glacier such as volume and length. They can be confused easily with the mass-turnover time; the reaction time; and the growth time. The volumetric response time is the most commonly seen formulation. Here the glacier changes from an initial volume V1 to a later volume V2, and the response time is the time needed for the volume to change by (V2 V1) (1 e-1), where e = 2.71828... Is the base of natural logarithms. The response time is much shorter than the time required to attain volume V2. Indeed, in this formulation the time to attain volume V2 is infinite. The change between state 1 and state 2 is assumed to be 'small'. The response time for volume is somewhat shorter than that for length, that is, for the length to change by (L2 L1) (1 e-1). The response time is an idealization. The essence of the idea is that the glacier 'remembers' its earlier steady state because it adjusts its size and shape by flow.

The mechanism of the anabatic wind can be described as follows. The warm surface heats a vertical column of the atmosphere starting at the slope surface and reaching up to a few hundred meters deep. This column is warmer than the column at the same levels over the valley or plain, resulting in hydrostatic low pressure over the slope relative to over the valley or plain. The horizontal pressure gradient, maximized at the slope surface, drives an acceleration directed toward the slope, or up the slope. Although the pressure-gradient forcing is at its maximum at the slope, surface friction causes the peak in the anabatic wind speeds to occur above the surface, often by several tens of meters; if the surface heating is strong, however, the momentum will tend to be vertically mixed. Speeds in the mountain-valley anabatic flow layer are often 3-5 m/s. Because heating at the surface promotes deeper mixing than cooling does, the heated layer, often occurring as a convective or mixed layer, is generally deeper than a cooled or katabatic layer. Slopes occur on many scales, and consequently anabatic flows also occur on many scales. At local scales anabatic winds are an along-slope component of mountain-valley wind systems. At scales ranging from the slopes of individual hills and mountains to the slopes of mountain ranges and massifs, anabatic flows represent the daytime component of mountain-plains wind systems.

Satellite radar altimeters (including ERS-1 and 2, Envisat and others) typically operate in the Ku band (13.5 ghz; 22 mm wavelength) and were designed primarily for oceanographic monitoring. Because of their relatively large footprint (several km), they are best suited for measuring elevationsof gently-sloping regions of the ice sheets. Steep or undulating terrain produces complex waveforms and difficulties in achieving accurate estimates of range (i. E. Distance). Surface and volume scattering also affect the radar pulse and create uncertainty in the effective depth of the reflecting horizon. Surface dielectric properties and roughness that cause scattering are time-varying and introduce errors in calculations of elevation change. Recent radar altimeters use synthetic aperture processing (see insar) that increases resolution and decreases slope errors relative to earlier radar altimeters. The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) used a C-band radar (5.6 ghz; 54 mm wavelength) and synthetic aperture processing to obtain an accurate map of surface elevations with near-global coverage.

Satellite radar altimeters (including ERS-1 and 2, Envisat and others) typically operate in the Ku band (13.5 ghz; 22 mm wavelength) and were designed primarily for oceanographic monitoring. Because of their relatively large footprint (several km), they are best suited for measuring elevationsof gently-sloping regions of the ice sheets. Steep or undulating terrain produces complex waveforms and difficulties in achieving accurate estimates of range (i. E. Distance). Surface and volume scattering also affect the radar pulse and create uncertainty in the effective depth of the reflecting horizon. Surface dielectric properties and roughness that cause scattering are time-varying and introduce errors in calculations of elevation change. Recent radar altimeters use synthetic aperture processing (see insar) that increases resolution and decreases slope errors relative to earlier radar altimeters. The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) used a C-band radar (5.6 ghz; 54 mm wavelength) and synthetic aperture processing to obtain an accurate map of surface elevations with near-global coverage. Cryosat-2, launched in April 2010, will also use insar to map glaciers and ice sheets. #{g: xqIHPGlacierMassBalance | h1629}",

When wet, the surface becomes a more nearly specular (forward) reflector and appears radar-dark instead of radar-bright. In the dry-snow zone radar returns are unaffected by liquid water, which is absent, and the scattering coefficient contains information on snow grain size and possibly on the accumulation rate. Scatterometers have relatively poor spatial resolution (several to some tens of kilometres), which can be improved by temporal averaging, but they compensate by offering wide and frequent coverage. Seawinds, on the polar-orbiting quikscat satellite (1999-2009) has been a productive scatterometer.

The freezing point is somewhat dependent upon the purity of the liquid; the volume and shape of the liquid mass; the availability of freezing nuclei; and the pressure acting upon the liquid. The freezing point is a colligative property of a solution and becomes proportionately lower with an increasing amount of dissolved matter.

Repeated annual contraction cracking of the Ice in the wedge, followed by freezing of water in the crack, gradually increases the width (and possibly the depth) of the wedge and causes vertical banding of the Ice mass. The surface expression of Ice Wedges is generally a network of Polygons. Ice Wedges growing as a result of repeated winter cracking are called Active Ice Wedges.

The size of Ice Wedges varies from less than 10 cm to more than 3 m in width at the top, commonly tapering to a feather edge at a depth of 1 to more than 10 m. Ice Wedges are formed in thermal contraction cracks (Figura 33) in which hoar frost forms and into which water from melting Snow penetrates in the spring. Repeated annual contraction cracking of the Ice in the wedge, followed by freezing of water in the crack, gradually increases the width (and possibly the depth) of the wedge and causes vertical banding of the Ice mass. The surface expression of Ice Wedges is generally a network of Polygons. Ice Wedges growing as a result of repeated winter cracking are called Active Ice Wedges. Inactive Ice Wedges can be stable and remain for many centuries without changing. Ice Wedges are more common in arctic environments than mountains due to differences in soil properties, topography and availability of water. #{g: xqTrombottoGeocryology | h1639}",

The index determined for air temperatures at 4.5 feet above the ground is commonly designated as the air freezing index, while that determined for temperatures immediately below a surface is known as the surface freezing-index.\" (Also called \"coldness sun.\") #{g: xqAMSglossary | h1620}\n\nThe cumulative number of degree-days below 0C for a given time period. Four main types of air freezing indices have been used: Approximate Freezing Index - calculated from the mean monthly air temperatures for a specific station without making corrections for positive degree-days (T > 0C) in spring and fall (Boyd, 1979); I_af = SUM (NT) where N = number of days per month for months with a mean monthly temperature below 0C during one complete year. T= mean monthly temperature. Total annual Freezing Index - calculated by adding all the negative mean daily air temperatures (C) for a specific station during a calendar year (Harris, 1981); I_af = SUM (T) where T = mean daily air temperatures (C) below 0C for one complete calendar year. _ Seasonal Freezing Index - calculated as the arithmetic sum of all the negative and positive mean daily air temperatures (C) for a specific station during the time period between the highest point in the fall and the lowest point the next spring on the cumulative degree-day time curve (Huschke, 1959); I_af = SUM (T) where T = mean daily air temperatures (C) during the time period between the highest temperature in the Fall and the lowest temperature in the Spring. _ Design Freezing Index - calculated by taking the average of the seasonal freezing indices for the three coldest winters in the most recent 30 years of record. If data for 30 years are not available, then the index is based on the coldest winter in the latest 10-year period of record (U.S. Army/Air Force, 1966). #{g: xqTrombottoGeocryology | h1639}\n\n#{g: xqGCW | h1619}",

Four main types of air freezing indices have been used: Approximate Freezing Index - calculated from the mean monthly air temperatures for a specific station without making corrections for positive degree-days (T > 0C) in spring and fall (Boyd, 1979); I_af = SUM (NT) where N = number of days per month for months with a mean monthly temperature below 0C during one complete year. T= mean monthly temperature. Total annual Freezing Index - calculated by adding all the negative mean daily air temperatures (C) for a specific station during a calendar year (Harris, 1981); I_af = SUM (T) where T = mean daily air temperatures (C) below 0C for one complete calendar year. _ Seasonal Freezing Index - calculated as the arithmetic sum of all the negative and positive mean daily air temperatures (C) for a specific station during the time period between the highest point in the fall and the lowest point the next spring on the cumulative degree-day time curve (Huschke, 1959); I_af = SUM (T) where T = mean daily air temperatures (C) during the time period between the highest temperature in the Fall and the lowest temperature in the Spring. _ Design Freezing Index - calculated by taking the average of the seasonal freezing indices for the three coldest winters in the most recent 30 years of record. If data for 30 years are not available, then the index is based on the coldest winter in the latest 10-year period of record (U.S. Army/Air Force, 1966). #{g: xqTrombottoGeocryology | h1639}",

The question of the maintenance of the jet stream is a cardinal problem of theoretical meteorology. Two such jet streams are sometimes distinguished. The predominant one, the polar-front jet stream, is associated with the polar front of middle and upper-middle latitudes. Very loosely, it may be said to extend around the hemisphere, but, like the polar front, it is discontinuous and varies greatly from day to day. A subtropical jet stream is found, at some longitudes, between 20 and 30 latitude and is strongest off the Asian coast.

They developed empirical formulas relating these data to the rate of heat loss from exposed human skin. They developed the following formula which was used to determine the wind-chill index. At wind speeds of 4 mph or less, the wind chill temperature is the same as the actual air temperature: T_WC = 0.0817(3.71V^0.5 + 5.81 - 0.25V)(T-91.4)+91.4 where V is wind speed in mph and T is temperature in F. #{g: xqAMSglossary | h1620}",

The melting point of a substance should be considered a property of its crystalline form only. At the melting point the liquid and solid forms of a substance exist in equilibrium. All substances of crystalline nature have their characteristic melting points. For very pure substances the temperature range over which the process of fusion occurs is very small. The melting point of a pure crystalline solid is a function of pressure; it increases with increasing pressure for most substances. However, in the case of ice (and a few other substances) the melting point decreases with increasing pressure (see regelation). Under a pressure of one standard atmosphere, the melting point of pure ice is the same as the ice point, that is, 0C. #{g: xqAMSglossary | h1620}",

The jet is produced when stable synoptic flow at low levels approaches the barrier and is blocked ( see blocking) for a significant fraction of a day or longer.

Because the air column is stable, the air layer near the surface is potentially colder (by definition) than the air layer above it, and the stratification opposes and retards the upslope flow.

At timescales greater than a pendulum day that required for geostrophic adjustment these processes produce a persistent barrier jet at heights below the level of the mountain.

Due to logistical constraints it is often impossible to conduct field surveys on these exact dates. Therefore the data need to be corrected, which is often done by estimating ablation and accumulation between the survey date and the fixed date using meteorological data from a nearby weather station or a database of upper-air measurements.

The accuracy of the duration is principally determined by the frequency of imaging, which tends to be high at high latitudes because most orbital sensors are in polar orbits. The melting index is a valuable proxy indicator in the absence of more direct measures of melting. The melting index is sometimes called the melt index or the surface-melt index, and is formulated in slightly different ways by different authors. #{g: xqIHPGlacierMassBalance | h1629}",

Aufeis (German), flood ice, flood-plain icing, ice field, naled (Russian) and overflow ice usually indicated icings formed on river ice and floodplains. Chrystocrene (or crystocrene), ground icing, groundwater icing and spring icing usually indicated icings formed by freezing of ground-water discharge.

The bise is typically driven by an anticyclone building to the northwest or north of the Alps. According to Wanner and Furger (1990), \"the cold air flow from the north and northeast is channeled between the Jura and the Alps and leads to the formation of the bise over the Swiss Middleland and the upper Rh\u00f4ne Valley. Thus, the bise is normally a postfrontal phenomenon and is closely connected with the advection of cold and dry continental air. Typically the classic bise endures about one to three days.\" The bise is most frequent in spring, when it usually brings fine, bright weather. In winter a special case of the bise occurs when the pressure gradient is produced by a Mediterranean cyclone system to the south of the Alps, bringing moist air in from the Balkans. Accompanied by heavy clouds, snow whirlwinds in the mountains, and rain, snow, or hail, this wind is called a \"black bise\" (bise noire in Switzerland and Sa\u00f4ne in east central France; bise n\u00e8gre in Aveyron in south central France). In spring the bise can last for several days and bring damaging frosts. In the Morvan in east central France the very dry bise in March is termed hale de mars (drying wind of March). In the Dr\u00f4me Valley southeast of Valence (southeast France) the name bise brume is given to a moist, mild, and sometimes foggy wind from the northwest.

Frost Action in fine-grained soils increases the volume of the soil not only by freezing of in situ pore water (9% expansion) but also by drawing water to the Freezing Front where Ice lenses form. Soils that have undergone substantial heaving may consist of alternate layers of Ice-saturated soil and relatively clear Ice lenses. The lenses are formed normal to the direction of heat flow and when freezing penetrates from the ground surface (which may be horizontal, sloping or vertical), they form parallel to that surface. When unrestrained, the amount of surface heave may be almost as much as the total thickness of the Ice lenses. Frost Heave can occur seasonally or continuously if freezing of the ground proceeds without interruption over a period of years. Differential, or non-uniform, frost heaving is one of the main aspects of the Frost Action process and reflects the heterogeneous nature of most soils, or variations in heat removal rate and groundwater supply over short distances. Depending on the degree of restraint, large Freezing Pressures (up to 1 MPa) can be developed as the ground freezes. #{g: xqTrombottoGeocryology | h1639}",

Crevasses form where the speed of the ice is variable, such as in icefalls and at valley bends. The surface may appear blistered with crevasses where the ice flows over bedrock knobs and ridges. Crevasses are a glacier's most awesome features and are a constant hazard for climbers. They form where adjacent parts of a glacier are moving at different speeds. This unequal rate of flow produces stresses in the ice that cause it to break. Groups of crevasses often form where the glacier flows over a steep place in its bed. The ice moves faster here, and pulls apart, and a crevasse is formed. Although a large crevasse may seem to be bottomless to the observer, most crevasses are less than 100 feet deep because ice pressure tends to close the open spaces in the ice below that depth. #{g: xqUSGSGlaciers(ambiguous) | -}\n\n#{g: xqGCW | h1619}",

A massive structure (not to be confused with massive ground-ice forms) is characterized by the predominant presence of Pore Ice and by relatively low total Ice Content. In soils with a reticulate structure, Ice Veins generally form a random net, whereas in those with a layered structure, well-oriented horizontal Ice Lenses alternate with soil layers having a massive structure. In both cases their total Ice Content is relatively high. #{g: xqTrombottoGeocryology | h1639}",

In mass-balance studies, except for ice discharge and for the special case of frontal ablation, lengths such as layer thicknesses are always measured parallel to the vertical axis and not normal to the glacier surface.

The glacier area excludes nunataks but includes debris-covered parts of the glacier.

During a radar sounding, segments of rough ice are depicted by increased brightness with ice ridges being indiscernible.
