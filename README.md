# YAMZ Metadata Dictionary

This is the README for the YAMZ metadictionary and includes instructions for
deploying on a local machine for testing and on a Linux based environment for a
scalable production version. These assume a Ubuntu GNU/Linux environment, but
should be easily adaptable to any system; YAMZ is written in Python and uses
only cross-platform packages.

The documentation is currently undergoing revision and will be reposted soon.
